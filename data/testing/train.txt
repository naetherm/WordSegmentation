Houthalen-Helchteren is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Limburg.
Houthalen-Helchteren consists of Houthalen-centrum, Houthalen-Oost, Helchteren, Sonnis, Laak, Meulenberg and Lillo.
On January 1, 2006, Houthalen-Helchteren had a total population of around 31.000.
The total area is 78.27 km² which gives a population density of 383 inhabitants per km².
Helchteren is located near the watershed between the Meuse and the Scheldt.
In the immediate vicinity the Dommel (which flows to the Meuse near Den Bosch), the Grote Nete (which flows to the Scheldt) and the Neer (that joins the Meuse just south of Roermond) all originate.
Helchteren could have become famous in 1702 when, during the War of the Spanish Succession, a French Army under Boufflers faced an alliance army under Marlborough.
A battle could have ensued, but instead it came to the not so famous cannonade of Helchteren.
The cannonade itself is however a seldom occurring event in military history.
The Taking is the third studio album by American rock band Loaded.
It was produced by Terry Date in Seattle, Washington, and was released on April 19, 2011 through Eagle Rock Entertainment.
Writing for the album began in 2009, while the band were touring in support of "Sick".
It will be the first Loaded release, since "", without drummer Geoff Reading, who, after departing the band, was replaced by Isaac Carpenter in September 2009.
A feature-length film about the album, as well as Loaded, by filmmaker and documentarian Jamie Burton Chamberlin is currently being filmed, with the album serving as the film's soundtrack.
In July 2009, singer and guitarist Duff McKagan announced, during Loaded's tour, that the band were writing new material for their next album.
He said that they have some "great ideas and riffs" that the band wrote during their tour.
Loaded parted ways with record label Century Media in February 2010 with the band continuing the work on new material.
Prior to the beginning of recording, producer Terry Date approached the band and offered to produce the new album, with recording beginning, at Studio X, in August 2010, and completed by the beginning of September.
On October 28, it was announced that the band had signed a deal with Eagle Rock Entertainment for the release of their album.
In November, Blabbermouth.net announced the album's title, "The Soundtrack", with a release date scheduled for March 22, 2011.
It was later revealed in interviews with guitarist Mike Squires and filmmaker Jamie Burton Chamberlin that the album title was changed to "The Taking", and the release date was change from March 22, to April 19, 2011.
A new song by Loaded from the album entitled "We Win" is being used by ESPN and Major League Baseball for their coverage of the American League Championship Series, National League Championship Series, and the World Series while a second song entitled "Fight On" was confirmed for the album.
Loaded performed the two new songs at the Seattle Seahawks Veterans Day half time show on November 7.
Loaded began collaborating with filmmaker and documentarian Jamie Burton Chamberlin on a film based on the album in October 2010.
Chamberlin stated that the film would be more "about designing a fictitious story line which will be a part of the larger project, and will be a contemporary version of, say, "Hard Days Night" meets (Led Zeppelin's) "Song Remains the Same", with aspects of documentary, music video, and live performance, all interconnected by an underlying motivation" and that the "album will serve as the soundtrack."
The film is to feature a number of cameos from various musicians, including John Roderick of The Long Winters, Chris Ballew of The Presidents of the United States of America, Soundgarden members Ben Shepherd and Kim Thayil as well as Lemmy of Motörhead.
Shooting locations for the film include Seattle, with the band planning to perform unannounced acoustic shows for filming, and Los Angeles.
Chamberlin hopes to premier the film at the 2011 SXSW while a trailer for the film was released in January 2011. "The Taking" received generally positive reviews, scoring a 65 out of 100 ("generally favorable reviews") on Metacritic based on five reviews.
Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars stating that McKagan "turns in his hardest record in recent memory" and that the album "does make a brute impression [...] playing with a vitality that almost compensates for how they fetishize the past." "Kerrang!"
magazine stated that with the album, "Loaded sound like a proper band now." "Revolver" magazine's Kory Grow complimented it's "big hooks and driving riffs" while noting punk influences on the album.
Joseph Viney, reviewing for Sputnikmusic, gave the album a three-and-a-half out of five stars, noting a darker tone throughout the album, with songs such as “Lords Of Abbadon,” “Executioner’s Song” and “She’s An Anchor” earning comparisons to Down and Alice in Chains.
Ultimate Guitar Archive commented that the album's music has "a bit of GN’R influence injected into it all, but [that] there’s just as much a heavy helping of punk and even 70’s glam" while they also complimented the lyrics stating they have "some fantastic moments."
David Jón Fuller of the "Winnipeg Free Press" stated "it's clear McKagan hasn't lost any of his musical swagger" and while "his vocals are little more than shouting [...] the sound is powerful and bottom-heavy."
Ashot Avagyan (; born May 20, 1958) is an Armenian painter.
Many of his works depict the suffering and loss he experienced during the Nagorno-Karabakh War, and inspired by ancient megalithic structures and ancient petroglyphs found in Syunik Mountains.
Ashot Avagyan was born in 1958 in Sisian, Armenia.
He defeated the region, the city and the megalithic structures during the war in Nagorno Karabakh.
In 1981 graduated from the Yerevan Art College after P. Terlemezyan.
He lives and develops his work in Sisian.
From 1981 till now teaches at Children Art School in Sisian.
Having the cultural heritage of different time periods of his living area as a standing point, the artist always seeks for searching new perspectives of world-perception.
The conceptual and artistic prospects of Neolithic petroglyphs to Middle Age iconographic culture are transposed from the surface of canvas into the forms of modern art, appearing in the context of performance.
Ashot is regularly creating art exhibitions in Sisian and attracts thousands of people to take part.
Ashot Avagyan devoted his life to teaching children in the remote town in South Armenia. 2000 – "The seven papers of Demiurge", Chamber Theatre, Yerevan, Armenia 2004 – "Magic double circle", Gevorgyan Gallery, Yerevan, Armenia 2008 – "Memories from previous life", Gevorgyan Gallery, Yerevan, Armenia Involve the areas of cultural and cult monuments of Neolithic period in Sisian (Ukhtasar petroglyphs, Zorats Karer, Portakar).

Mirage Studios is an independent American comic book company founded in 1983 by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in Dover, New Hampshire, and currently based in Northampton, Massachusetts.
They are best known for the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" comic book series and the subsequent franchise it has spawned.
Mirage Studios was started back in 1983, in Dover, NH.
The company was named "Mirage" because there was no actual company.
Less than a year before TMNT #1 was published in May 1984.
Mirage then moved to Sharon, CT and stayed there for two years before ending up in Northampton.
With the success of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Eastman and Laird hired a core group of artists to help with the increasing workload.
The first addition to the studio roster was Eastman's high school friend Steve Lavigne, brought on in 1984 as a letterer.
In 1985, Eastman and Laird hired Cleveland artist Ryan Brown to assist them as an inker for the Turtles.
Brown would be the first in a long line of artists, other than Eastman and Laird, that would work on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series.
In the following year, two new members were added, penciler Jim Lawson from Connecticut and New Jersey's Michael Dooney who would paint a number of covers.
With the addition of these four core artists along with Peter and Kevin, Mirage's Ninja Turtles output would expand over the next couple of years to include numerous Mirage Studio spin-off titles, as well as a companion comic book entitled "Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles".
In 1989, Kevin Eastman invited freelance illustrator A.C. Farley to do cover paintings for the TMNT collected books.
Peter Laird also invited Farley to do issue #29 of the TMNT comic.
Farley was eventually invited to be part of the studio and crafted many paintings and comic artwork for the TMNT until his departure from the studio to resume his freelance business in 2004.
In 1991, Mirage Studios secured an interlocutory injunction against Counter-Feat Clothing for similar designs of drawings.
The Mirage artists operated out of a renovated factory space in Florence, Massachusetts.
This is where the bulk of the creative output was done, such as the Playmates Toys toy designs and the Archie TMNT comic series, until Tundra Publishing took over the building.
Eastman and Laird along with Brown, Dooney, Lavigne and Lawson and Farley toured extensively over the years, making personal appearances and attending many comic book conventions in Detroit, Chicago, Hawaii, San Diego, Ohio, Boston, and Portsmouth, New Hampshire among many others.
As the TMNT went mainstream, later additions to the studio would include Eric Talbot from Eastman's and Lavigne's old high school, writer Stephen Murphy, and Brown's friend, Dan Berger, who was brought in from Ohio to ink the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventure title from Archie Comics.
In 1988, Mirage Studios participated in the drafting of the Creator's Bill of Rights for comic book creators.
On October 21, 2009 it was announced that Viacom had purchased all of Mirage's rights to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles property.
Mirage retains the rights to publish 18 issues a year, though the future involvement of Mirage with the Turtles, and the future of Mirage itself, is unknown.
Mirage Studios have produced a lot of titles, although most did not remain in publication for more than a few issues.
Comics published include:
In physiology, sensory transduction is the conversion of a sensory stimulus from one form to another.
Transduction in the nervous system typically refers to stimulus-alerting events wherein a physical stimulus is converted into an action potential, which is transmitted along axons towards the central nervous system for integration.
It is a step in the larger process of sensory processing.
A receptor cell converts the energy in a stimulus into an electrical signal.
Receptors are broadly split into two main categories: exteroceptors, which receive external sensory stimuli, and interoceptors, which receive internal sensory stimuli.
In the visual system, sensory cells called rod and cone cells in the retina convert the physical energy of light signals into electrical impulses that travel to the brain.
The light causes a conformational change in a protein called rhodopsin.
This conformational change sets in motion a series of molecular events that result in a reduction of the electrochemical gradient of the photoreceptor.
The decrease in the electrochemical gradient causes a reduction in the electrical signals going to the brain.
Thus, in this example, more light hitting the photoreceptor results in the transduction of a signal into fewer electrical impulses, effectively communicating that stimulus to the brain.
A change in neurotransmitter release is mediated through a second messenger system.
Note that the change in neurotransmitter release is by rods.
Because of the change, a change in light intensity causes the response of the rods to be much slower than expected (for a process associated with the nervous system).
In the auditory system, sound vibrations (mechanical energy) are transduced into electrical energy by hair cells in the inner ear.
Sound vibrations from an object cause vibrations in air molecules, which in turn, vibrate the ear drum.
The movement of the eardrum causes the bones of the middle ear (the ossicles) to vibrate.
These vibrations then pass into the cochlea, the organ of hearing.
Within the cochlea, the hair cells on the sensory epithelium of the organ of Corti bend and cause movement of the basilar membrane.
The membrane undulates in different sized waves according to the frequency of the sound.
Hair cells are then able to convert this movement (mechanical energy) into electrical signals (graded receptor potentials) which travel along auditory nerves to hearing centres in the brain.
In the olfactory system, odorant molecules in the mucus bind to G-protein receptors on olfactory cells.
The G-protein activates a downstream signalling cascade that causes increased level of cyclic-AMP (cAMP), which trigger neurotransmitter release.
In the gustatory system, perception of five primary taste qualities (sweet, salty, sour, bitter and umami [savoriness] ) depends on taste transduction pathways, through taste receptor cells, G proteins, ion channels, and effector enzymes.
In the somatosensory system the sensory transduction mainly involves the conversion of the mechanical signal such as pressure, skin compression, stretch, vibration to electro-ionic impulses through the process of mechanotransduction.
It also includes the sensory transduction related to thermoception and nociception.
M.I.M.E.O. (or MIMEO) is an experimental electroacoustic free improvisation group formed in 1997 on the initiative of several independent concert promoters in Europe.
The abbreviation stands for "Music In Movement Electronic Orchestra".
They have issued recordings on Erstwhile Records, Cathnor, Perdition Plastics, Grob, and other labels.
Their album "Sight" (2007) was inspired by painter Cy Twombly.
Each of the eleven members of M.I.M.E.O. (spread across Europe) placed approximately five minutes of sound anywhere they chose onto a blank sixty-minute CDR.
This was done independently of one another, with no communication between the musicians about how or where the music should be distributed on the disc.
The CDRs were then compiled onto one CD and sent to a pressing plant.
Pianist John Tilbury joined the group to record the album "The Hands of Caravaggio" (2001, Erstwhile).
Critic Brian Olewnick describes the album as "A staggering achievement, one is tempted to call The Hands of Caravaggio the first great piano concerto of the 21st century."
Though some members have been temporarily replaced when unavailable for recording or performing, the group now consists of:
Edmund John (27 November 1883 – 28 February 1917) was a British poet of the Uranian poetry school.
His verses were modeled on the Symbolist poetry of Algernon Charles Swinburne and other earlier poets.
Much of his work was condemned by critics for being overly decadent and unfashionable.
He fought in the First World War but was invalided out in 1916.
He died a year later in Taormina, Sicily.
Philip Jessup (February 5, 1897 - January 31, 1986), also Philip C. Jessup, was a 20th-century American diplomat, scholar, and jurist notable for his accomplishments in the field of international law.
Philip Caryl Jessup was born on January 5, 1897, in New York, New York.
He was the grandson of Henry Harris Jessup In 1919, he received his undergraduate A.B. degree from Hamilton College.
In 1924, he received a law degree (LLB) from Yale Law School.
In 1927, he received a doctorate from Columbia University.
From 1925 to 1961, Jessup held teaching positions at Columbia University.
While pursuing his doctorate, and for a good time thereafter (1925–1946), Jessup served as a lecturer and professor in international law at Columbia Law School.
From 1942 to 1944, he served as assistant director of the Naval School of Military Government and Administration at Columbia University.In 1946, he was named the Hamilton Fish Professor of International Law and Diplomacy at Columbia Law, a post he held until 1961.
In 1970, he was Sibley lecturer at University of Georgia's School of Law in Athens, Georgia.
In 1971, he was Barnette Miller Lecturer at Wellesley College.
In 1924, Jessup became an assistant solicitor for the United States Department of State.
In 1929, he assisted Elihu Root for the Conference of Jurists on the Permanent Court of International Justice in Geneva, Switzerland.
In 1943, Jessup served as assistant secretary-general of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) conference through 1944.
From 1943 to 1945, he also served as chief of the Division of Personnel and Training for Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation Operations at the State Department.
In 1944, he also served at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference (the "Bretton Woods" conference).
In 1945, he was a technical advisor to the American delegation to the San Francisco United Nations charter conference in 1945 (whose Acting Secretary was Alger Hiss).
In 1947, he served as U.S. representative to the United Nations Committee on Codification of International Law.
From 1948 through 1952, he served in several roles at the United Nations: U.S. representative to the General Assembly (second, third, and fourth special sessions), deputy U.S. representative to the Interim Committee of the General Assembly and Security Council, and deputy chief of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations.
From 1949 to 1953, he also served as "Ambassador-at-large."
In 1960, Jessup was elected to become a member of the International Court of Justice at the Hague, where from 1961 to 1970 he served as a judge.
From 1938 to 1951, Jessup served as chairman of the Pacific Council and member of its parent, Institute of Pacific Relations.
By 1948, he had become a trustee of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which continued at least through 1956.
From 1967 to 1986, he served as chairman of the Chile-Norway Permanent Commission and as an honorary member of the Governing Council for the International Institute for Unification of Private Law.
From 1970 to 1971, he was a Whitney H. Shepardson senior research fellow in residence at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Jessup became a primary target of Senator Joseph McCarthy, who charged in the 1950 Tydings Committee hearings that Jessup was a security risk who had "an unusual affinity... for Communist causes."
McCarthy wasn't allowed by the Tydings Committee to outline his case regarding Jessup but the committee did allow Jessup to fly in from Pakistan and give his defense.
Jessup was subsequently cleared of all charges by the Loyalty Board of the State Department and the Tydings Committee, and McCarthy was rebuked by many fellow senators and other statesmen.
However, in two speeches on the floor of the Senate, McCarthy gave his evidence regarding Jessup's "unusual affinity for Communist causes": McCarthy's allegations severely damaged Jessup's reputation and career.
Nonetheless, President Harry S. Truman appointed Jessup as United States delegate to the United Nations in 1951.
However, when the appointment came before the Senate it was not approved, largely because of McCarthy's influence.
Truman circumvented the Senate by assigning Jessup to the United Nations on an "interim appointment."
Shortly after John F. Kennedy took office as president, the State Department approved the appointment of Jessup as U.S. candidate for the International Court of Justice, a post that did not need Senate confirmation.
He served from 1961 until 1970.
Upon returning from the Netherlands, Jessup took up a series of academic positions at the University of Georgia School of Law, Columbia University, and Wellesley College.
In 1921, Jessup married Lois Walcott Kellogg.
Jessup died on January 31, 1986, in Newtown, Pennsylvania.
Jessup is the uncle of television writer Ted Jessup.
An international law moot court competition, the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition, is named in Jessup's honor.
It is held annually in Washington D.C. and is attended by law students from around the world.

Look for a Star is a 2009 Hong Kong romantic comedy film that was produced and directed by Andrew Lau.
Inspired by the relationship between Stanley Ho and his fourth wife, Angela Leong, the film stars Andy Lau as a billionaire, who falls in love with a feisty casino dealer played by Shu Qi. "Look for a Star" was shot at the MGM Grand in Macau, and was released in Hong Kong on 26 January 2009.
It is love at first sight when Sam (Andy Lau) chances upon a feisty, fast-talking woman with the odd name of Milan (Shu Qi) at a Macau casino.
But the catch is, she is a part-time Baccarat dealer and a full-time cabaret dancer, "careers" not exactly congruent with his station in life.
Fallen in love against all odds, this mismatched couple soon makes headline in all media which turn Milan into an It girl overnight. "Look for a Star" is a Hong Kong and Chinese co-production that marks the sixth collaboration between producer, director, and cinematographer Andrew Lau and Cantopop singer and actor Andy Lau.
It is also the second film collaboration between Andy Lau and actress Shu Qi.
Both actors and the director worked together on the 2002 science fiction action film, "The Wesley's Mysterious File", although Andy Lau had expressed wanting to make a romantic comedy with Shu. "Look for a Star" was distributed by Media Asia Entertainment Group in Hong Kong and produced by Media Asia, Chinese film studio Huayi Brothers, and Andrew Lau's production company, Basic Pictures.
Shot under a budget of HK$45 million, the film is reportedly based on the relationship between casino tycoon Stanley Ho and his fourth wife, Angela Leong. "Look for a Star" was supported by the Macau Government Tourist Office, and shot at the MGM Grand Macau, best known for its spectacular Grande Praca swimming pool and deluxe villa suites.
Other filming locations included Macau's Southern European architecture, including the Old Ladies House, the Guia Lighthouse and the Coloane village.
Uncial 0301 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), is a Greek-Coptic diglot uncial manuscript of the New Testament.
Paleographically it has been assigned to the 5th century.
The codex contains two small parts of the text of the Gospel of John 17:1-2.2-4, on a fragment of single parchment leaf (6.82 cm by 7 cm).
It was written in one column per page, 14 lines per page, in uncial letters.
Because it is very small fragment, it was suggested, it is a talisman, but the manuscript is more probable.
Currently it is dated by the INTF to the 5th century.
It is currently housed at the Schøyen Collection (1367) in Oslo.
Sir William Gordon Harris KBE CB (10 June 1912 – 20 February 2005) was a British civil engineer.
His early career was with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and in the Sudanese Irrigation Department before he began a 26-year spell with the Admiralty Civil Engineers Department.
Harrisrose to become Civil Engineer in Chief in 1959 and was responsible for building facilities to cope with the change in focus of the Royal Navy from gunnery ships to aircraft carriers and submarines, including the nuclear submarine docks at Faslane.
Harris was later made director-general of highways in the Ministry of Transport during which time he was responsible for the construction of the 650 miles of motorway, a focus on ground investigation at pre-tender stage and the development of new motorway signalling and telecommunications systems.
He later entered private practice as a consulting engineer and was chairman of the Port of Dover.
Harris also served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers and of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers.
Harris was born in Liverpool on 10 June 1912 to Captain James Whyte Harris and Margaret Roberts Buchanan Harris (née Forsyth).
His father was a captain in the Royal Naval Reserve.
Harris was educated at Liverpool College before studying the Mechanical Sciences Tripos at Sidney Sussex College, University of Cambridge.
Harris worked for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway as an engineer from 1932 until 1935 when he transferred to the Irrigation Department of Sudan.
He returned from Sudan in 1937 to work in the Civil Engineer's Department of the Admiralty, the start of a 26-year association with that department.
Harris married Margaret Harvie in 1938, they would have three sons and one daughter together and would be grandparents to sixteen.
Harris received several promotions during his time with the Admiralty, becoming Assistant Civil Engineer in Chief in 1950, Deputy Civil Engineer in Chief in 1955 and Civil Engineer in Chief in 1959.
Harris gained a Commonwealth Fund of New York Scholarship in 1950 which allowed him to spend two years with the US Navy Bureau of Yards and Docks.
In 1960 he became the Director-General of Navy Works at the Admiralty, a post he would hold until the reorganisation which followed the merger of the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and British Army administrations into the Ministry of Defence in 1963.
During his time with the Admiralty Harris saw the last large gunnery ships go out of service to be replaced with submarines and aircraft carriers.
This change of fleet composition required a revolution in dockyard facilities, for which he was responsible, especially those at Faslane, the submarine base.
In the 1963 Queen's Birthday Honours Harris was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, and also became Director-General of Works at the Ministry of Public Building and Works.
From 1965 Harris was the Director-General of Highways at the Ministry of Transport (later the Department of the Environment).
During this time he was responsible for all design, construction and maintenance of roads in England.
He was responsible for securing agreement from the county councils and the Association of Consulting Engineers on road schemes and for presenting these to the secretary of state, Barbara Castle.
In 1967-68 he split England into six regions, each the responsibility of a roads construction unit to manage the delivery of regional infrastructure.
Harris was chair of a committee into contracting by the ministry and recommended that competitive tendering be maintained but that more ground investigation was required into the subsoil prior to tender and that this information should be shared with the contractor.
He also implemented the use of standard methods of compaction in place of the more time-consuming method of validation testing after the works were completed.
Harris implemented a new signalling system for motorways and implemented a new telecommunications system, for which he allocated £27 million of funding.
Harris's tenure as Director-General saw the construction of 650 miles of motorways and an expenditure of £2.2 billion on new road construction.
Harris was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1969 Queen's Birthday Honours.
Harris was the chief British delegate to the Permanent Association of Navigation Congresses (PIANC) from 1969 until 1985 and from 1970 to 1971 was the country's chief delegate to the Permanent Association of Roads Congresses.
Harris was a vice-president of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) from 1971 to 1974 and president from November 1974 to November 1975.
He also updated the ICE's contract documentations (including the 5th edition of ICE Conditions of Contract published in June 1973) and its standard method of measurement.

Anne Stevenson (born January 3, 1933) is an American-British poet and writer.
She is a recipient of a Lannan Literary Award.
Stevenson's parents Louise Destler Stevenson and C.L.
Stevenson met at a Cincinnati High School.
They were living in Cambridge, England, where Charles was studying philosophy under I.
A. Richards and Wittgenstein, when their first daughter, Anne was born.
The family returned to America when Anne was six months old, moving to New Haven, her father going on to teach at universities including Harvard and Yale.
She was raised in New England, the eldest of three daughters and was educated in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where her father was a professor of philosophy.
Her father was a devoted pianist and lover of poetry and her mother wrote fiction and was a talented storyteller.
Stevenson learnt piano and cello and she assumed until she was 19 that she would be a professional musician.
She studied music and languages, at the University of Michigan, where she began to lose her hearing; she prepared to be a writer instead.
Obtaining her bachelor's degree in 1954 and graduating with honours, she returned to the UK where she has lived most of her life.
Stevenson married a childhood friend but her romantic ideals dissolved and the marriage was not a success.
She notes that "it took me two unhappy marriages and three children to make me reconsider my assumptions."
In the 1960s she lived and wrote in Cambridge, Glasgow, Dundee and Oxford.
She was writer in residence at the University of Dundee and co-founded "Other Poetry" (magazine) with Evangeline Patterson.
In 1979, with Michael Farley, she started The Poetry Bookshop in Hay-on-Wye and in 1982 she moved to Sunderland, then Durham, where she now lives with her husband Peter Lucas.
As of 2011 she had six grandchildren.
Stevenson is the author of over a dozen volumes of poetry, of some books of essays and literary criticism, of a controversial biography of the American poet Sylvia Plath, "Bitter Fame: A Life of Sylvia Plath" (1989), and two critical studies of Elizabeth Bishop.
Stevenson uses a hearing aid; several of her poems (including "Hearing with my Fingers" and "On Going Deaf") refer to her experience of deafness.
Alfred Hickling at the "Guardian" reviewed Stevenson's work: To arrive at a true understanding of Anne Stevenson's poetry, you have to go deep.
In fact, the Deep is a very good place to start.
Jutting into the Humber estuary like a vast steel fin, the Deep is Hull's impressive new aquatic attraction - where you expect to find tropical fish rather than topical poetry - yet the first thing the visitor sees, before descending to the bottom of Europe's deepest tank, is a line by Stevenson: "The sea is as near as we come to another world."
A night game, also called a nighter, is a sporting event that takes place, completely or partially, after the local sunset.
Depending on the sport, this can be done either with floodlights or with the usual low-light conditions.
The term "night game" is typically used only in reference to sports traditionally held outdoors.
Although indoor sporting events often take place after local sunset, these events are artificially lighted regardless of the time of day they take place.
A baseball game was played under electric lighting in 1880, the year after Thomas Edison invented the light bulb.
It was an experimental game between two department store teams, and it would take another fifty years before organized baseball would sanction night baseball.
There were a couple of exhibition night baseball games in the early 1900s between organized baseball teams.
One of them was in 1909, and the other was in 1927, but the games did not count in league standings.
Even though the games were between professional teams, they were unofficial experiments and did not count as the "nocturnal first".
In 1929, the president of the Des Moines, Iowa baseball club announced to the National Association convention he was going to play night baseball in 1930.
However, the first official minor league night game actually took place in Independence, Kansas on April 28, 1930.
An article in the April 1931 edition of Baseball Magazine stated that Independence was the first team in America to play a league night baseball game.
After the game in Independence, night baseball "spread like wildfire" across the minor leagues.
In addition to that, in 1935, The Sporting News pointed out that Des Moines, Iowa was not the first to install permanent lights, but it was in fact Independence that did so.
By the end of the 1934 season there were sixty-five minor league teams with permanent lights installed on their fields.
The light towers installed in Independence in 1930 were removed and scrapped in June 1990.
Mickey Mantle, an Independence Yankee in 1949, played under the historic lights.
Lighting technology had significantly improved since the 1927 night game exhibition.
After fifty years of experiments, a new era in professional baseball was about to start.
The Independence Producers of Independence, Kansas were a Class C minor league baseball team that played in a stadium known now as Shulthis Stadium.
They purchased lights from the Giant Manufacturing Company and installed permanent lights on their field.
When Independence played the night game on April 28, 1930, it made Independence the birthplace of professional night baseball.
By the end of the 1930 season there were thirty-eight minor league teams with lights installed on their fields.
Independence played the first night game in the history of Organized Baseball on April 28, 1930.
The term Organized Baseball refers to Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball games.
Organized Baseball games must follow specific rules in order to be Organized Baseball games.
The Commissioner of Baseball has authority over Organized Baseball.
Independence lost the league game to the Muskogee Chiefs by a score of 13-3.
Independence had previously played an exhibition game against the House of David, a professional baseball team, but the game did not qualify as an Organized Baseball game.
Independence did however defeat the House of David with a score of 9-1.
Since Independence had played a night baseball game before any Major League teams did so, the first night game in the history of Organized Baseball took place in Independence, Kansas.
Numerous references, photos, and media clippings discussing the first night Organized Baseball game are available can be found on websites.
After the 1930 game in Independence, night baseball did spread to other countries.
The first night game baseball game in Canada took place in Vancouver, Canada in 1931.
In 1933 Japan played their first night baseball game, and Cuba did so in 1937.
The first big-league team to play games at night was the 1930 Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues, who often played against the House of David baseball team, who carried portable lights mounted on trucks along with their team bus.
The last non-expansion/non-relocated team to play all their home games in the daytime were the Chicago Cubs; they played their first official night game in Wrigley Field on August 9, 1988 and beat the New York Mets 6–4, one night after their initial attempt at night baseball (against the Philadelphia Phillies) was rained out before it became official.
The Cubs still play the fewest home night games of any major league club (35 per season, as of 2014).
The first night All-Star Game was held at Philadelphia's Shibe Park in 1943, while the first World Series night game was Game 4 of the 1971 Series at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh.
All All-Star Games since 1969, and all World Series games since Game 6 of the 1987 Series, have been played at night.
The use of floodlights in cricket matches has helped to bring much investment into the game both at a national and an international level since it began in 1977.
Today floodlit (day/night) cricket is played in most of the test playing nations although some nations have only started hosting day/night matches in the last 10 to 12 years.
Many important tournaments like Indian Premier League and Champions League Twenty20 have become success due to night games.
Cricket was first played under floodlights on Monday, August 11, 1952 in England which was watched by several million people on their television sets.
Since then every test playing country has installed floodlights in their stadiums.
Traditional Cricket floodlights have a long pole on which lights are fixed.
This is done because many times the ball travels too high when a batsman hits it and high lights are needed to keep the ball in sight.
But many cricket stadiums have different types of floodlights like ANZ Stadium in Australia, stadiums in New Zealand etc.
The DSC Cricket Stadium in Dubai recently installed Ring of Fire system of floodlights which is latest and smartest system of floodlight in the world.
The term has also been adopted by other outdoor stadium sports such as American football and Canadian football.
The first night football game was played in Mansfield, Pennsylvania on September 28, 1892 between Mansfield State Normal and Wyoming Seminary.
It ended bitterly at halftime in a 0–0 tie.
In 1893 at the Chicago's World Fair, the Chicago A.
A. played a night football game against West Point.
Chicago won the 40-minute game 14–0.
On November 21, 1902, the Philadelphia Athletics of the first National Football League defeated the Kanaweola Athletic Club, 39–0, at Maple Avenue Driving Park in the first professional football night game.
The first night football game west of the Mississippi River was played in Wichita, Kansas in 1905 between Cooper College (now Sterling College of Sterling, Kansas) and Fairmount College (now Wichita State University).
The first NFL game played at night was in 1929 when the Chicago Cardinals played the Providence Steam Roller.
Automobile races at night can take on two different forms.
Sports car races such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans and rally races such as Monte Carlo Rally manage to continue running through the night by having the competing cars utilize headlights.
The alternate possibility involves installing a system of flood lights along the circuit to illuminate it for cars that do not have headlights.
The lights must be designed to diffuse light over a large space to reduce glare on both windshields and a driver's visor.
Systems such as this have been common in short track motor racing for many years.
The night NASCAR race at Bristol Motor Speedway's half-mile track in Tennessee is among the most popular events of the season.
The first modern oval track over 1 mile (1.609 kilometers) long to install a lighting system was Charlotte Motor Speedway in 1992.
NASCAR sanctioned races have been held at night for many years due to systems like these.
MotoGP held its first night race at Losail International Circuit in 2008.
Formula One held its first night race at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix.
Crawley College is a college of further education in West Sussex.
It offers courses ranging from Sixth form and Adult education to undergraduate courses through partnerships with universities.
Crawley College was formed in 2017 after a merger between Central Sussex College with Chichester College.
Central Sussex College was formed in August 2005 from a merger of Crawley College and Haywards Heath College.
Crawley College of Further Education was opened in 1958 by West Sussex County Council at the campus in Crawley town centre.
The college offers many technical courses, particularly in engineering fields, and was later known as Crawley College of Technology from 1977 until 1989.
Haywards Heath Grammar School opened on 9 September 1958, being run by East Sussex Education Committee with 800 boys and girls.
It became a sixth form college.
Haywards Heath College was established in 1980 and offered mainly courses for 16- to 18-year-old students following on from compulsory education.
Central Sussex College had five campuses across the county, offering a variety of services at each, and a commercial training centre in Horsham, Horsham Training Centre.
Central Sussex College has closed two of their campuses due to a £25 million debt.
The East Grinstead campus closed in the summer of 2016 and the Haywards Heath campus closed in the summer of 2017.
There had also been discussions about selling of one of the rear car parks in the Crawley campus in order to pay off some of the debt.
In 2017 it was revealed that Central Sussex College was looking at merging with Chichester College; the idea was welcomed by both colleges.
In an interview with S. Wright and S. Legrave (the Central Sussex College Principal and the Chichester College Principal) they said "We believe that a merger between our colleges will create opportunities around financial sustainability and ensure a diverse and employer led curriculum to meet local business and community needs...We remain committed to ensuring quality teaching and learning and believe that collaboration provides the opportunity to grow income, share costs and work in broader geographical areas." during the summer of 2017 the merger took place, Central Sussex College, in Crawley was renamed "Crawley College", the same name it had when it was during it last merger in 2005.
The college has trainee hairdressing, beauty salons, and a restaurant open to the public.
These allow students to train with real customers.
Intuition is the brand name for the college's trainee hairdressing and beauty salons at Crawley
Pasighat Airport or Passighat Airport is located at Pasighat in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, India.
The airstrip was laid down during the Sino-Indian War of 1962 and saw little use after the war until the Indian Air Force signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Arunachal Pradesh to develop the airstrip in 2009.
The IAF took over the airstrip in February 2010.
An Air Traffic Control Tower, apron for parking aircraft, a perimeter road and security wall was constructed.
The upgraded airstrip was inaugurated by Kiren Rijiju in August 2016 and a Sukhoi Su-30 fighter of the Indian Air Force landed on the airstrip as part of the inaugural function.
The Airports Authority of India (AAI) operates a civil enclave at Pasighat.
A new passenger terminal was built in 2017.
A helicopter service on behalf of the Arunachal Pradesh government is operated by Pawan Hans between Pasighat and various regional stations.
In April 2018, an Air India Regional ATR-42 aircraft carried out a test landing at the Pasighat ALG, in preparation for scheduled commercial services under the Regional Connectivity Scheme called UDAN.
Villelaure is a commune in the Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in southeastern France.
The village takes its name from the Roman-era settlement of "Villa Laura" which was at the same location or nearby.
Since Roman times, a nucleus of inhabitants lived near the present village.
However, like all the southern Luberon, Villelaure and its region were completely ruined in the second half of the 14th century by the ravages of the Hundred Years War and the Black Death.
Villelaure is one of about forty localities, on both sides of the Luberon, in which at least 1,400 families from the alpine valleys of Piedmont and approximately 6,000 people came from the alpine dioceses of Turin and Embrun between 1460 and 1560.
In 1512, Antoinette de la Terre, assisted by her husband Jean de Forbin, established Villelaure with 19 families from the neighboring villages and Piedmont.

Open coding in grounded theory method is the analytic process by which concepts "(codes)" to the observed data and phenomenon are attached during qualitative data analysis.
It is one of the 'procedures' for working with text as characterized by Strauss (1987) and Strauss and Corbin (1990).
Open coding aims at developing substantial codes describing, naming or classifying the phenomenon under consideration.
Open coding is achieved by segmenting data into meaningful expressions and describing them in single words or short sequence of words.
Further, relevant annotations and concepts are then attached to these expressions.
Open coding may be applied in varying degrees of detail.
The codes can be linked to a line, a sentence, a paragraph or wholesome text (protocol, case, etc.).
The application of the alternatives depends on the research question, on the relevant data, personal style of analyst and the stage of research.
However, while coding, the main aim of coding should be in sight i.e. to break down and understand the text and develop categories to be put in order in the course of time.
The result of open coding should be a list characterising codes and categories attached to the text and supported by code notes that were produced to explain the content of codes.
These notes could be striking observations and thoughts that are relevant to the development of theory.
Although codes are exclusive to the research material and the style of the analyst, but it is suggested researcher should address the text with the following questions:
Thecadactylus solimoensis is a species of gecko described in 2007.

Model organism databases (MODs) are biological databases, or knowledgebases, dedicated to the provision of in-depth biological data for intensively studied model organisms.
MODs allow researchers to easily find background information on large sets of genes, plan experiments efficiently, combine their data with existing knowledge, and construct novel hypotheses.
They allow users to analyse results and interpret datasets, and the data they generate are increasingly used to describe less well studied species.
Where possible, MODs share common approaches to collect and represent biological information.
For example, all MODs use the Gene Ontology to describe functions, processes and cellular locations of specific gene products.
Projects also exist to enable software sharing for curation, visualization and querying between different MODs.
Organismal diversity and varying user requirements however mean that MODs are often required to customize capture, display, and provision of data.
Model organism databases generate, source and collate species-specific information integratively by combining expert knowledge with literature curation and bioinformatics.
Services provided to biological research communities include:

Brian Patrick Bannister (born February 28, 1981) is an American former professional baseball starting pitcher.
He played for the New York Mets and Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball from 2006 through 2010 and is currently the assistant pitching coach for the Boston Red Sox.
Bannister is married and has one daughter, Brynn, who was born in the 2008 offseason.
He is a devout Christian and the oldest son of former Major League All-Star pitcher Floyd Bannister, who pitched from 1977 to 1992 with Houston, Seattle, Chicago (AL), Kansas City, California, and Texas.
His uncle, Greg Cochran, also played in the Yankees' and Athletics' minor league systems.
His brother Brett spent time as a pitcher in the Mariners' system, and his brother Cory pitched at Stanford.
Brian and Brett are both members of Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity.
Bannister was born in Scottsdale, Arizona.
He had a remarkable high school career at Chaparral High School, former home of Chicago White Sox star Paul Konerko, as he was named All-Region and All-City in 1997, 1998 and 1999.
Chaparral was the runner-up to the state title in 1997 and 1998, but in Bannister's senior year, he helped take home the state championship by striking out seven of the nine batters he faced in the championship game.
He began his college career as a walk-on at the University of Southern California.
Entering as a second baseman, he became a full-time pitcher before the start of his freshman season.
He posted an ERA of 4.35 in ten games out of the bullpen in his freshman year.
Acting as the team closer during his 2001 sophomore campaign, he compiled a 2.80 ERA in thirty-five relief appearances.
Bannister helped the Trojans to the College World Series in both 2000 and 2001 while pitching alongside former Major Leaguers Mark Prior and Anthony Reyes.
He redshirted in 2002, due to arthroscopic elbow surgery to remove impinged scar tissue in his elbow.
He was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in 2002, but did not sign.
He returned to the Trojans in 2003 to play his junior year, which was also his first year as a starter.
In eighteen games (fourteen starts), Bannister compiled a 6–5 record with an ERA of 4.53.
Bannister was drafted by the Mets in the seventh round of the 2003 amateur draft and, after signing, was assigned to the Class-A Brooklyn Cyclones.
There he put together a strong season, posting a 4–1 record with an ERA of 2.15 in twelve games (nine starts) and was named a New York–Penn League Postseason All-Star.
In 2004, Bannister was assigned to play for High-A St. Lucie in the Florida State League, where he put together a 5–7 record with a 4.24 ERA in twenty starts and was a Florida State League All-Star.
His experimentation with throwing a two-seam fastball and circle changeup led to this decline in numbers, but prepared him for the competition at higher levels of professional baseball.
Bannister was then promoted to AA Binghamton following the trade of Scott Kazmir to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, where he had a 3–3 record and an ERA of 4.08 in a mere eight starts.
After the 2004 season, Bannister played for the Peoria Saguaros of the Arizona Fall League.
He posted strong numbers, going 2–0 with a 3.77 ERA against the top prospects in the minor leagues.
More importantly, he developed his cut fastball while in the AFL, which would develop into one of his strongest pitches.
The next year, Bannister began the 2005 season in Double-A Binghamton, where he posted numbers that reflected the quality of his newly developed pitches: a 9–4 record with a 2.56 ERA in eighteen starts.
This earned him an All-Star selection for the third consecutive season, and the honor of starting pitcher for the Double-A All-Star Game.
This display caused Bannister to earn a promotion to AAA Norfolk, where he showed further promise against better competition.
He finished his AAA campaign with a 4–1 record and an ERA of 3.18 in eight starts.
At 25 years old, Bannister made his Major League debut against the Washington Nationals.
His first major league win came in his second start, also against Washington, on April 11, 2006.
A former second baseman, Bannister also excelled at the plate, acquiring four hits in his first ten at-bats, including three doubles.
After making five starts, Bannister was put on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right hamstring which he injured while running the bases in the fifth inning of an April 26 game against San Francisco.
Bannister was later moved to the 60-day DL.
Bannister made 5 starts for the Mets and had a record of 2–0 with a 2.89 ERA.
Bannister spent a month on a Minor League rehab assignment, pitching for the St. Lucie Mets and the Norfolk Tides.
When Orlando Hernández was unable to pitch in late August, Bannister made a spot start against the Phillies, giving up 4 runs in 6 innings in a 4–3 loss.
The game was Bannister's first major league defeat.
Immediately after the game, Bannister was optioned to AAA Norfolk to allow Óliver Pérez to make a spot start the following day.
Bannister returned to the Mets for the month of September and made two relief appearances.
On September 6, 2006, the Brooklyn Cyclones honored Bannister with his own bobblehead and retired his number, 19.
Bannister was the first pitcher from the Cyclones to make his Major League debut with the Mets.
Because his hamstring injury reduced the number of innings pitched in 2006, Bannister joined the Tomateros de Culiacán in the Mexican Pacific League.
He won in his debut, pitching five innings against the Algodoneros de Guasave.
After completing the first half of the season with the Tomateros, Bannister returned home with a 3–2 record and a 3.68 ERA.
On December 5, 2006, during the MLB Winter Meetings, Bannister was traded from the New York Mets to the Kansas City Royals for relief pitcher Ambiorix Burgos.
In spring 2007, Bannister's high school jersey number, 15, was retired alongside former Chaparral High School players Darryl Deak, Brian Deak, coach Mark Miller, and former Chicago White Sox star Paul Konerko.
On April 24, 2007, Bannister made his debut with the Royals against the Chicago White Sox.
He gave up 4 runs, 3 of them earned runs, in 4 and 1/3 innings, and was not involved in the decision.
In June 2007, Bannister was one of two major league pitchers to win 5 games, going 5–1 with a 2.75 ERA in six starts, including a streak of 18 innings without an earned run, and was named AL Rookie of the Month.
He also received the same award in August after winning 4 games in the month.
On August 16, 2007, Bannister threw his first career complete game, a four-hitter against the A's.
He threw 111 pitches, 73 for strikes.
Bannister finished 3rd in the 2007 American League Rookie of the Year voting, after finishing 12–9 with a 3.87 ERA.
He received 1 first place vote, 8 second place votes, and 7 third place votes.
Bannister was selected to the 2007 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team.
The selection was the result of the 49th annual Topps balloting of Major League managers.
In 2008, he was named the Royals' number-2 starter behind Gil Meche.
He led the majors in grand slams allowed, with four.
He regressed from his 2007 form, and saw his ERA spike from 3.87 to 5.76.
He finished with among the highest loss totals for starting pitchers that year, finishing 9–16.
On 8/17/2008 against The Yankees, Bannister gave up 10 earned runs on 10 hits (3 homeruns) and 3 walks while pitching only one complete inning.
After a poor 2008, Bannister started the 2009 season with AAA Omaha before promptly being called up a week later to fill the number 5 spot in the rotation.
After adding a new changeup to his repertoire, his ground ball rate increased and he had a 7–7 record and a 3.59 ERA into early August, ranking in the Top 10 in the American League in ERA and being the subject of numerous trade deadline rumors.
Unfortunately, he suffered a season-ending right rotator cuff tear in a 117 pitch game August 3 against Tampa Bay.
After attempting to pitch with the injury and losing five consecutive starts, he was placed on the disabled list for the rest of the season.
He finished the year compiling a record of 7–12 with a 4.73 ERA.
Bannister spent the winter rehabilitating his shoulder and returned to what would be his last MLB season.
His ineffectiveness was obvious, and he struggled with giving up home runs and pitching deep into games.
On June 23, 2010, Bannister and the Royals handed Washington Nationals phenom Stephen Strasburg his first career loss in a 1–0 victory in Washington.
His season finished with a miserable loss at Cincinnati, a minor league rehab stint, and a loss to the Minnesota Twins.
In 2010, he was chosen as "honorable mention" in a list of the smartest athletes in sports by "Sporting News".
In January 2011, Bannister signed a two-year contract to play for Japan's Yomiuri Giants.
In March, Bannister retired following the earthquake and tsunami in Northern Japan, stating he had no further plans to play in either Japan or the United States.
He currently runs a fund that supports non-profit organizations for families in crisis in the San Francisco Bay Area.
During his pitching career, Bannister became known in baseball for his interest in scouting and player analysis and evaluation.
He became interested in statistical analysis and Sabermetrics such as FIP and UZR as means of determining a player's true value.
On January 13, 2015, Bannister joined the Boston Red Sox as a member of its professional scouting department.

Bannister graduated cum laude from the University of Southern California with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the School of Fine Arts.
His work has been featured in the New York Times, New York Daily News, and American Photo.
Pablo Manlapit (January 17, 1891 – April 15, 1969) was a migrant laborer, lawyer, labor organizer and activist in Hawaii and the Philippines.
Manlapit was born on January 17, 1891 in the Philippines.
He came to Hawaii in 1909 as a migrant worker and worked as a sugarcane plantation laborer at Hamakua Mill Company in the sugarcane fields of the Hāmākua district of the island of Hawaii.
He later on moved to Oahu.
In June, 1912, he married Annie Kasby, a Hawaiian of German-American descent and they started to raise a family in Hilo.
He left the plantation job and moved to the city and worked in various office jobs while studying law.
The Filipinos were the last large group of recruited sugarcane plantation workers to migrate to Hawaii.
From 1907 to 1931, approximately 120,000 Filipino men came to Hawaii.
When they came to Hawaii's plantations, they found that they had to buy everything at the plantation store, and often at highly inflated prices due to shipping and other costs.
After living in Hawaii for a while, many began to resent the strict hand of the "luna" (foreman), and social discrimination that they experienced.
They were also not used to the commercial business system.
Many believed the practice of fixed prices in the plantation stores to be a violation of their personal freedom because they were accustomed to bargaining in the Philippines.
The oldest, poorest housing was given to the Filipinos because they were the lowest skilled and held the least prestigious jobs.
They were also the most recent arrivals to Hawaii.
Immigration laws did not permit them to bring families, so the men lived in barracks.
Manlapit became one of the few Filipino lawyers in the 1920s and distinguished himself as spokesman for the Filipino labor movement in Hawaii, spending most of his time organizing and fighting for the rights of plantation laborers.
He helped organize the Filipino Labor Union in Hawaii and was a leading figure in the strikes in 1920 and 1924 that involved thousands of plantation workers.
In October, 1919, the Japanese Federation of Labor and the Filipino Labor Union joined together to argue against the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association for a better working environment.
They wanted to increase their salary from $0.72 to $1.25 and have 8 hour workdays.
They wanted breaks for certain working conditions.
On Oahu on January 19, 1920, 3,000 members of the Filipino Labor Union walked off their jobs.
Manlapit led the strike and he believed that the Japanese and Filipinos workers should be united.
The Japanese workers soon joined them.
By early February 1920, 8300 plantation laborers were on strike, representing 77% of the work force.
Filipino workers went on strike because they weren't paid equally for doing the same work as the Japanese workers.
The Filipinos were paid $0.69 and the Japanese were paid $0.99.
While they were on strike, plantation workers on other islands continued to work to raise about $600,000 in support of the strike.
The 1920 Oahu strike lasted for two months and the strikers had to contend with a variety of methods utilized by the plantation owners: eviction of strikers from their homes, hiring of strikebreakers, and prosecution of leaders for conspiracies.
Manlapit was not prosecuted but he was subjected to a smear campaign.
He was accused of extorting money in exchange for calling off the strike.
The plantation owners, assisted by the government, countered this with a "divide-and-counter" tactic.
They charged the Japanese workers with attempting to make Hawaii an Asian province.
Later in the year the Japanese changed the name of their union to the Hawaiian Federation of Labor, in an effort to counter racist accusations.
They invited all workers of every race to join.
So strong was his influence among his countrymen that Manlapit was implicated in the violent September, 1924 strike on Kauai—later known as the Hanapēpē Massacre—even though he wasn't there.
Sixteen strikers were killed during the confrontation with police, as well as four policemen.
This drew the ire of plantation owners and they persecuted him with various small charges.
Manlapit was arrested with 60 other Filipinos, tried for conspiracy, and sentenced to 2 to 10 years at Oahu Prison.
In order to prevent his involvement in future activities in Hawaii, Manlapit was deported to the U.S. mainland while bearing a conditional parole judgment.
Upon his parole, he went to California.
In California, Manlapit also went into labor organizing until he traveled back to Hawaii in 1933.
Again, he dove into the fray of labor organizing and this eventually led to his permanent expulsion from Hawaii and deportation to the Philippines in 1935.
His family was broken because of this move.
This ended his colorful but tragic career in the Hawaii labor movement.
Manlapit worked for the Philippine government in the pre-World War II and postwar years.
He supported Manuel Roxas in his presidency bid after World War II and served in some mid-level government positions before getting involved once more in labor matters.
He also raised a second family in the Philippines.
He died of cancer on April 15, 1969.

The Taker/Tulsa is a 1971 album by Waylon Jennings.
The LP rose to #12 on the "Billboard" country albums chart while the single "The Taker" was a Top 5 hit single. "The Taker/Tulsa" is notable for featuring four compositions by Kris Kristofferson, who had emerged as a beacon for songwriters who wanted to bring a new poetic realism to country music.
Jennings, who had bristled when RCA producers told him what songs to record, began demanding more control over his records on all fronts, and began recording songs by newer songwriters like Kristofferson, Shel Silverstein, and Mickey Newbury.
Jennings was particularly taken with the Kristofferson ballad "Lovin' Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)" but was stymied by RCA's recording policies, recalling in the audio version of his autobiography "Waylon": Although Jennings continued working with RCA producers like Danny Davis, his records began sounding less and less like his early work with the label.
In his book "Outlaws: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville", author Michael Striessguth writes, "Most important, Waylon appeared to have found his voice.
Whether Davis had anything to do with that or not, the Davis-produced tracks showcase deeply riveting vocals amid bold instrumentation on starkly realistic songs, many of which appeared on "The Taker/Tulsa"..."

Palm Beach Lakes Community High School, also known as Lakes or PBL, is a coeducational public high school located in the Palm Beach Lakes community of West Palm Beach, Florida.
It is under the jurisdiction of the School District of Palm Beach County.
The school has the Teacher's Academy Program and serves as the Law Magnet for the entire county.
Once having an enrollment of over 3,500, Palm Beach Lakes was once one of the largest schools in its district.
However, due to Florida's Class Size Amendment and the continuous building of high schools in the district, Palm Beach Lakes has a school enrollment of just over 3,000.
However, it still remains one of the largest high schools in South Florida.
Palm Beach Lakes Community High School was established in 1989 after the closing of Twin Lakes High School (a merging of Palm Beach High School and Roosevelt High School) in downtown West Palm Beach.
Central School was the first school on "The Hill," built in 1908 to replace a four-room schoolhouse located a half-mile to the northeast, at Clematis Street and Dixie Highway.
Parents at the time worried about sending their children so far out of town into the wilderness, and residents wondered if the town would ever grow into the school.
It did.
A new high school building — Palm Beach High School — opened there in 1915.
A third building was added in 1922, and a fourth in 1927.
In 1970 the school changed its name to Twin Lakes, which closed in June 1988.
It briefly operated as Palm Beach Lakes High until that school's new campus opened in 1989.
Palm Beach High School served as the original site of Palm Beach Junior College, now Palm Beach State College.
County school superintendent Joe Youngblood and Howell Watkins, the principal of Palm Beach High School who later became the college's first dean, were instrumental in opening the college.
The college's initial goal was to provide additional training to local high school graduates who were unable to find jobs during the Great Depression.
PBJC was founded in 1933 and is the oldest community college in the state of Florida.
At the start of the 1970–1971 school year, Palm Beach High School merged with Roosevelt High School forming Twin Lakes High School.
The latter, Roosevelt High, was established as the high school for African Americans in West Palm Beach.
They were athletic rivals with John F. Kennedy High School, the High School for African-Americans in Riviera Beach.
During integration, this school would go on to become part of Suncoast Community High School.
However, the school maintained its original location and became John F. Kennedy Jr. High School, later becoming a middle school serving grades 6-8.
Roosevelt High was located at the site of the current Roosevelt Service Center, on the Northwest corner of Tamarind Avenue and L. A. Kirksey Street (15th Street).
This site would also become known as Roosevelt Junior High School in the 1960s.
The name of the new school was Twin Lakes High School, derived from the fact that the merging of the schools had integrated them, and also that the new school setting was diverse with differing groups of ethnicities merging into a future that was united.
Logic suggests the school's new name referred to the adjoining lakes west of downtown: Lake Mangonia, near Roosevelt, and Clear Lake, near Palm Beach High.
The site was located in Downtown West Palm Beach at the current Dreyfoos School of the Arts site.
Palm Beach High School then ceased to exist, as did Roosevelt High School.
During the 1988-89 school year, another historical high school in West Palm Beach, North Shore High School (notable alumni include Derek Harper), merged with Twin Lakes High School.
However, the name of this merger became Palm Beach Lakes High School.
The site of the new Palm Beach Lakes High School, located at its current location at the intersection of Military Trail and 45th Street in West Palm Beach, was not completed until midway through the school year.
Once completed midway through the school year, all of the Palm Beach Lakes High School students, faculty, and staff moved to their new campus.
The physical structure of Twin Lakes High School was closed and was due to be demolished once Palm Beach Lakes High School officially opened.
It was only by heroic efforts by PBHS Alumni that the buildings were saved and subsequently repurposed as Dreyfoos School of the Arts.
Similar efforts from North Shore High School's alumni helped save their old school from destruction.
Today, Bak Middle School of the Arts (the feeder arts school for Dreyfoos) is located on the former campus of North Shore High School.
Graduates of Palm Beach High School have never considered themselves to be anything but proud PBHS Wildcats and trophies and other memorabilia are now stored in a small museum in downtown West Palm Beach.
The school's major sports rivals are Palm Beach Gardens Community High School, William T. Dwyer High School,and Suncoast Community High School.
Palm Beach Lakes holds an annual basketball tournament, known as the Derek Harper Holiday Tournament.
It is named after the retired NBA guard Derek Harper.
Teams from Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties participate in the tournament which draws thousands each year.
The event is held the week after Christmas for 4 days.
The Port of Yingkou is an international seaport in Yingkou, Liaoning, People's Republic of China.
It is the second-largest port in northeast China and the tenth-largest nationwide.
It includes two separate dockland areas, the "Yingkou old port" at the mouth of the Liao River, and the "Bayuquan" port located directly on Liaodong Bay on the Bohai Sea.
The port is a major import facility for northeastern China and parts of Mongolia with an annual trade volume of more than 21 million metric tons (MT) through 27 shipping berths.
Principal port activities include grain and sugar, timber, oil tar, coal, steel and minerals, and vehicle imports.
The port also handles up to 250,000 containers per year.
Yingkou Port Group Co.'s services also include bulk cargo loading, pipeline transportation, railway and highway transportation.
Apart from docks it also operates tugboats, pilot boats, barges and communication ships.
River and coastal trade have existed in Yingkou since 1280 AD, but international shipping commenced in 1858 with Yingkou's designation as a "Treaty Port" under the Treaty of Tianjin.
The first shipping dock was opened at the mouth of the Liao River in 1864.
Over the next ten years additional docks were constructed at the mouths of the Hun and the Tai, collectively forming what is now known as "Yingkou old port."
The expiry of the treaty led to a decline in shipping and a reversion to a principally domestic port.
The port was revived following the Chinese economic reforms of the late 1970s which led to the construction of the "Bayuquan Port" on Liandong Bay.
These new facilities added 20 more shipping berths with a break bulk capacity of ten million MT a year.
In 1996 the Chinese government-owned shipping company COSCO partnered with Yingkou port authorities to develop a container terminal at Bayuquan Port with an annual capacity of 250,000 TEU's. 40,000 containers were handled in the first year of operation, rising to 150,000 by 2000 and reaching the terminal capacity in 2007.
In 2013 Yingkou port announced a 9.8 % increase in container throughput to 2.68 million TEU in the first six months of the year.
Import and export volume increased to 166.3 million tons, up by 10.7%.
In 2015, Yingkou Port was listed among the top 50 container ports in the world, with a TEU volume of 5.92 million.
In November 2016 a strategic partnership was formed between the Yingkou Port Group Corporation and Russian Railways.
The goal of the agreement was to establish a joint international terminal and logistics center in Russia.
As part of the agreement Yingkou Port agreed to acquire a 49% stake in the Bely Rast Terminal Logistics Center of Russian Railways.
Minor allele frequency (MAF) refers to the frequency at which the "second most common" allele occurs in a given population.
SNPs with a minor allele frequency of 0.05 (5%) or greater were targeted by the HapMap project.
MAF is widely used in population genetics studies because it provides information to differentiate between common and rare variants in the population.
As an example, a recent study sequenced the whole genomes of Sardinian individuals.
The authors classified the variants found in the study in three classes according to their MAF.
It was observed that rare variants (MAF < 0.05) appeared more frequently in coding regions than common variants (MAF > 0.05) in this population. 1.
Introduce the reference of a SNP of interest, as an example: rs429358, in a database (dbSNP or other). 2.
Find MAF/MinorAlleleCount link.
MAF/MinorAlleleCount: C=0.1506/754 (1000 Genomes); where C is the minor allele for that particular locus; 0.1506 is the frequency of the C allele (MAF), i.e. 15% within the 1000 Genomes database; and 754 is the number of times this SNP has been observed in the population of the study.
Nigel Gareth Davies (born 29 March 1965) is a former Wales international rugby union player, who played his club rugby at Llanelli RFC.
His son Sam Davies is a professional rugby union player.
Davies was born in Waun y Clun, Trimsaran and as a youth player played for local rugby union club Trimsaran RFC.
In his final year of playing for the youth team he was invited by Llanelli RFC to play for them in a friendly match, from which he impressed enough to be selected by the club.
Davies played 498 games for Llanelli including nine WRU Challenge Cup finals.
Davies was appointed assistant coach to the Wales national team under Gareth Jenkins and was appointed caretaker Head Coach following the departure of Jenkins after the 2007 Rugby World Cup.
In May 2008 Davies was announced as the head coach of the Scarlets, replacing Phil Davies who moved to the Scarlets board of directors.
In June 2012 Davies joined Gloucester as Director of Rugby.
After a poor season in 2013-14, Davies was sacked by Gloucester.
In June 2015 Davies was announced as Ebbw Vale RFC Head Coach
Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS, also written ISIS) is a routing protocol designed to move information efficiently within a computer network, a group of physically connected computers or similar devices.
It accomplishes this by determining the best route for data through a packet-switched network.
The IS-IS protocol is defined in ISO/IEC 10589:2002 as an international standard within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference design.
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) republished IS-IS in RFC 1142, but that RFC was later marked as "historic" by RFC 7142 because it republished a draft rather than a final version of the ISO standard, causing confusion.
IS-IS has been called "the "de facto" standard for large service provider network backbones."
IS-IS is an interior gateway protocol, designed for use within an administrative domain or network.
This is in contrast to exterior gateway protocols, primarily Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is used for routing between autonomous systems (RFC 1930).
IS-IS is a link-state routing protocol, operating by reliably flooding link state information throughout a network of routers.
Each IS-IS router independently builds a database of the network's topology, aggregating the flooded network information.
Like the OSPF protocol, IS-IS uses Dijkstra's algorithm for computing the best path through the network.
Packets (datagrams) are then forwarded, based on the computed ideal path, through the network to the destination.
The IS-IS protocol was developed by Digital Equipment Corporation as part of DECnet Phase V. It was standardized by the ISO in 1992 as ISO 10589 for communication between network devices that are termed Intermediate Systems (as opposed to end systems or hosts) by the ISO.
The purpose of IS-IS was to make possible the routing of datagrams using the ISO-developed OSI protocol stack called CLNS.
IS-IS was developed at roughly the same time that the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF was developing a similar protocol called OSPF.
IS-IS was later extended to support routing of "datagrams" in the Internet Protocol (IP), the Network Layer protocol of the global Internet.
This version of the IS-IS "routing" protocol was then called "Integrated IS-IS" (RFC 1195) Both IS-IS and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) are link state protocols, and both use the same Dijkstra algorithm for computing the best path through the network.
As a result, they are conceptually similar.
Both support variable length subnet masks, can use multicast to discover neighboring routers using "hello packets", and can support authentication of routing updates.
While OSPF was natively built to route IP and is itself a Layer 3 protocol that runs on top of IP, IS-IS is an OSI Layer 2 protocol.
It is at the same layer as Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP).
The widespread adoption of IP may have contributed to OSPF's popularity.
IS-IS does not use IP to carry routing information messages.
OSPF version 2, on the other hand, was designed for IPv4.
IS-IS is neutral regarding the type of network addresses for which it can route.
This allowed IS-IS to be easily used to support IPv6.
To operate with IPv6 networks, the OSPF protocol was rewritten in OSPF v3 (as specified in RFC 2740).
Both OSPF and IS-IS routers build a topological representation of the network.
This map indicates the subnets which each IS-IS router can reach, and the lowest-cost (shortest) path to a subnet is used to forward traffic.
IS-IS differs from OSPF in the way that "areas" are defined and routed between.
IS-IS routers are designated as being: Level 1 (intra-area); Level 2 (inter area); or Level 1–2 (both).
Routing information is exchanged between Level 1 routers and other Level 1 routers of the same area, and Level 2 routers can only form relationships and exchange information with other Level 2 routers.
Level 1–2 routers exchange information with both levels and are used to connect the inter area routers with the intra area routers.
In OSPF, areas are delineated on the interface such that an area border router (ABR) is actually in two or more areas at once, effectively creating the borders between areas inside the ABR, whereas in IS-IS area borders are in between routers, designated as Level 2 or Level 1–2.
The result is that an IS-IS router is only ever a part of a single area.
IS-IS also does not require Area 0 (Area Zero) to be the backbone area through which all inter-area traffic must pass.
The logical view is that OSPF creates something of a spider web or star topology of many areas all attached directly to Area Zero and IS-IS by contrast creates a logical topology of a backbone of Level 2 routers with branches of Level 1–2 and Level 1 routers forming the individual areas.
IS-IS also differs from OSPF in the methods by which it reliably floods topology and topology change information through the network.
However, the basic concepts are similar.
OSPF has a larger set of extensions and optional features specified in the protocol standards.
However IS-IS is easier to expand: its use of type-length-value (TLV) data allows engineers to implement support for new techniques without redesigning the protocol.
For example, in order to support IPv6, the IS-IS protocol was extended to support a few additional TLVs, whereas OSPF required a new protocol draft (OSPFv3).
In addition to that, IS-IS is less "chatty" and can scale to support larger networks.
Given the same set of resources, IS-IS can support more routers in an area than OSPF.
This has contributed to IS-IS as an ISP-scale protocol.
The TCP/IP implementation, known as "Integrated IS-IS" or "Dual IS-IS", is described in RFC 1195.
IS-IS is also used as the control plane for IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB).
SPB allows for shortest-path forwarding in an Ethernet mesh network context utilizing multiple equal cost paths.
This permits SPB to support large Layer 2 topologies, with fast convergence, and improved use of the mesh topology.
Combined with this is single point provisioning for logical connectivity membership.
IS-IS is therefore augmented with a small number of TLVs and sub-TLVs, and supports two Ethernet encapsulating data paths, 802.1ad Provider Bridges and 802.1ah Provider Backbone Bridges.
SPB requires no state machine or other substantive changes to IS-IS, and simply requires a new Network Layer Protocol Identifier (NLPID) and set of TLVs.
This extension to IS-IS is defined in the IETF proposed standard RFC 6329.

, romanized as Freeza in Japanese merchandise, Funimation's English subtitles and Viz Media's release of the manga, is a fictional character in the "Dragon Ball" manga series created by Akira Toriyama.
Frieza makes his debut in Chapter #247: , first published in "Weekly Shōnen Jump" magazine on October 6, 1989, as a galactic tyrant feared as the most powerful being in the universe.
Despite not appearing until the manga's second half, Frieza is considered to be the most iconic antagonist from the "Dragon Ball" franchise due to effectively serving as the catalyst of many of the events depicted in the story, such as Goku's arrival on Earth, the Saiyans landing on Earth, and subsequently the main characters going to planet Namek.
In his appearances in the manga itself, he is also directly responsible for the murder of Goku's father Bardock, the genocide of the Saiyan race, the death of Vegeta, and the second death of Goku's best friend Krillin, arguably making him Goku's most personal and significant enemy, and the final confrontation between Goku and Frieza has been hailed as one of the most memorable manga and anime battles ever.
Frieza later appeared as the antagonist in the theatrical film "" and as an antagonist and recurring character in "Dragon Ball Super".
Frieza, a broker who forcibly takes over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the "worst kind of people."
Toriyama purposely does not draw bad guys so unscrupulous that it affects one psychologically, although he admits Frieza is close.
Therefore, he paid special attention to how Frieza spoke; because villains typically speak rudely, he gave him polite speech making for an unsettling contrast with his cruelty.
The character's name is a pun on freezer, and because of this the members of the Ginyu Force are named after items one would normally put in a refrigerator.
The "Shenlong Times" issue #2, a bonus pamphlet given to some buyers of the "Daizenshuu 2: Story Guide" guidebook, says that Frieza was modeled after Toriyama's editor at the time, Yū Kondō.
Frieza so far possesses five transformation forms, each one being quite different and more powerful from the previous ones.
It is implied that Frieza's fourth form is actually his basic one, with the other three being transformations that suppress his power in order to conserve it, while the fifth one unleashes his true power.
Toriyama revealed that he did not think to have Frieza transform until about midway through.
He said he has a habit of making characters gradually more tough and complex-looking, until finally making them very sleek, as it is a pain to draw them if their appearance is too complex.
The author confirmed this is why Frieza's third and most intricate form is only shown for a short time, and joked that three transformations might be one too many.
Before the start of the series, Frieza destroys Planet Vegeta, as Beerus asked him to do so, out of both fear of a potential uprising by the Saiyans due to their increasing power and the prophecy of the coming of the legendary Super Saiyan.
Frieza spares only Vegeta, Nappa, and Raditz, offering them wealth for their loyalty.
However, when Raditz's father made a final stand when Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, he did not notice the Saiyan's second son being sent to Earth where he became known as Goku.
Frieza makes his official appearance in the story after Vegeta's defeat on Earth at Goku's hands, having traveled to Planet Namek to find the seven Namekian Dragon Balls to wish for immortality.
He and his men massacre Namekian villages one after another, until Gohan, Krillin, and Vegeta begin to hamper his efforts in their own way.
Though Frieza manages to gain the Dragon Balls, with the Ginyu Force dealing with the interlopers, his inability to speak Namekian forces him to find the Great Elder of Namek.
Frieza ends up fighting Namekian warrior Nail, whom he beats repeatedly until Nail reveals that their fight was only to buy time for Dende to give the words needed to activate the Namekian Dragon Balls, for the warriors from Earth.
With his entire army killed by Vegeta and the Ginyu Force defeated by Goku, Frieza intercepts Vegeta and the others personally.
Frieza briefly battles Vegeta, with the Saiyan Prince goading him into transforming and revealing his true power.
Frieza transforms into his second form, and during the battle he finally admits to be the one who had destroyed the planet where the Saiyans had settled.
After defeating Vegeta, Frieza takes on Piccolo, who has at this point fused with Nail.
Although Piccolo appears to be even with him, he transforms into his third form and dominates the powerful Namekian.
Following a brief tussle with Gohan, Frieza decides to transform into his final form.
He kills Dende to stop him from healing the others and mortally wounds Vegeta just as Goku arrives, who just recovered following his fight with the Ginyu Force.
Frieza fights Goku and brutally beats him, however Goku manages to seriously wound him with a Genki-Dama.
Frieza then critically injures Piccolo and murders Krillin, which sends Goku over the edge to assume Super Saiyan form for the first time.
Frieza starts to realize that he is outmatched and damages the core of Namek in an act of desperation.
He then uses 100% of his power (he had been using 50% up until that point), and regains the advantage, however he cannot sustain this form and is ultimately cut in half.
Though Goku spares the crippled Frieza while leaving for his ship to escape the planet's destruction, he ends up seemingly killing Frieza when he makes a final attempt on Goku's life.
But in reality, Frieza survives both the attack and Namek's explosion, drifting through space until he is found by his father and rebuilt with cybernetic prosthetics.
A year later, Frieza and King Cold travel to Earth in order to exact revenge on Goku and his friends, but they are confronted by Trunks, Vegeta and Bulma's son from the future.
After a brief battle, Frieza is sliced to pieces by Trunks and blasted into oblivion, with his father following shortly afterwards.
Despite finally being dead, his cells are used as a catalyst for the future villain Cell.
After Frieza's death, his spirit was kept imprisoned in Earth's Hell, where he was tortured by being forced to endure the playful antics of an overly saccharine cadre of angels while reliving the memories of his defeats at the hands of Goku and Trunks.
But fourteen years after Frieza's demise, his two surviving subordinates Sorbet and Tagoma collected all of the Dragon Balls with the aid of the Pilaf Gang and resurrect him as his disemboweled Mecha Frieza form.
The two bring Frieza to their ship and use their advanced medical technology to restore Frieza to full organic form.
Bent on revenge while learning that Goku defeated Majin Buu and fought Beerus to a stalemate (the only two beings in the universe Frieza was warned never to cross by his father), Frieza decides to undergo four months of intensive training and achieves a new form which he dubs "Golden Frieza" and sets off for Earth with his army.
On Earth, the Z Fighters battle Frieza's minions to stall for time so that Goku and Vegeta, off on a training session with the gods Whis and Beerus, can return.
Frieza executes his defeated army for their incompetence just as Goku, Vegeta, Beerus, and Whis arrive.
Goku and Vegeta reveal their new Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan forms, and battle Frieza, killing Sorbet in the crossfire.
Although Frieza's Golden form is stronger than Goku's strongest form, Frieza's stamina can not endure a prolonged fight with this form, and he is eventually cornered by Vegeta.
Frieza destroys the Earth in retaliation for his defeat, killing Vegeta while he survives, but Whis rewinds time and allows Goku to kill Frieza once more.
Frieza returns to Hell, where he is once more tormented by the angels.
In the later story arc featuring the tournament between the 6th and 7th Universes, Frieza himself does not appear, however his Universe 6 counterpart Frost (フロスト, "Furosuto") makes an appearance as the second fighter on Team Universe 6.
Frieza appears in the manga adaption omake alongside Sorbet and Susami in Hell.
In the Universal Tournament Arc, Frieza becomes the 10th member of the Universe 7 team after Majin Buu is ineligible to fight.
When visited by Goku in Hell, later revealed to have mentally trained himself maintain his Golden form, Frieza accepts the offer on the condition of being revived by the Dragon Balls after the tournament.
Universe 4 finds out about Frieza's enrollment into the Universe 7 team, and convinces Universe 9 to hire assassins to kill him as he is brought back to the living world by Fortuneteller Babba for 24 hours.
Goku meets up with Frieza, but before they can meet up with the others they are stopped by a group of assassins that are claiming their heads.
Frieza kills most of the assassins before trapping Goku in an energy attack, taking one of the assassin's communicators as he attempted to deal with Universe 9's leaders to join their group before being forced to destroy the item when Beerus and Whis appear.
Beerus believes Frieza is plotting something, but Goku vouches for him and the two return to meet with the rest of their team.
During the tournament, meeting Frost and setting up an alliance with him to take out the Saiyans, Frieza forces Universe 9's Roselle to forfeit and then easily disposes of Universe 10's Murichim.
Frieza later spots Gohan struggling against Universe 2's Jimeze, eventually deciding to intervene and brutally defeats Jimeze.
When Frost appears to commence their arrangement Frieza, revealed to tricked his Universe 6 counterpart, momentarily knocks Gohan out so he can eliminate Frost while his guard was down before aiding Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, and Androids 17 and 18 in defeating Universe 3's fighter.
Frieza becomes one of the four combatants standing alongside Goku, Android 17 and Universe 11's Jiren, unexpectedly teaming up with Goku to force Jiren out in a triple elimination with 17 declared the winner.
Frieza is resurrected soon after by Whis at the behest of Beerus as a reward for his efforts and take his leave to begin rebuilding his empire.
During the events of the film "", Frieza started to rebuild his forces while deciding to use Earth's Dragon Balls to make a wish to increase his height by five centimeters.
Freiza recruited Broly and Paragus who accompany him to Earth for the last Dragon Ball, realizing the former's potential as he matched Goku and Vegeta in their Super Saiyan Blue forms.
This inspires Freiza to kill Paragus to force Broly's transformation into a Super Saiyan, ending up being attacked by Broly after he quickly defeated Goku.
But Freiza is saved at the last second by Gogeta, who thwarts his attempt to kill off his former subordinates Chirai and Lemo when they used the Dragon Balls to save Broly's life with Frieza falling back while vowing revenge.
Frieza is capable of moving at superhuman speeds, flying, and has quick reflexes.
Like most characters in the series, he can harness a supernatural energy known as "Ki" and manipulate it into powerful and devastating concussive beams of said energy, with which he is able to destroy planets with relative ease.
Some of Frieza's signature "ki" techniques include the , a sharp piercing beam from his finger, and the , a large energy sphere he used to destroy planet Namek.
He is capable of surviving in the vacuum of space, and also seems to possess some form of telekinesis, being able to lift opponents without touching them and cause them to explode.
Frieza's power was so great over time, that his body could not comfortably contain it and a series of physical transformations were developed that limit his actual strength.
While changing shape from his "first-form", each alteration builds on the previous.
In all, Frieza has three transformed states, each with increasing power, some larger than others and each resulting in different physical attributes, although the two transformed states (along with his first form) were merely to suppress Frieza's power, and that his third transformed state is actually his true form, while a fourth further transformation that he discovered after his four months of training actually increases his power drastically and lets out most of his latent strength.
In his weakest form, Frieza is a relatively short humanoid with a large chestnut-shaped skull and two horns.
He also has a tail with a spiked end, as well as having three talon-like toes.
Frieza wears the same upper-body armor and shorts that many of his subordinates are shown to wear, and while traveling, often gives the appearance of weakness by exclusively using his hoverchair for transportation, leaving his henchmen to do his "dirty work".
Though frail in comparison with his succeeding forms, Frieza still boasts sufficient force to destroy planets.
While shifting to his next stage, Frieza breaks his battle-jacket, revealing a natural white armor covering his chest and shoulders.
Frieza's 6th Universe counterpart, Frost, also initially appears in this form.
His second form is much larger, both in height and muscle mass.
He grows longer horns, which now instead of protruding sideways from his head curve sharply upwards into near right angles.
In this form, Frieza does not have any trouble taking out Vegeta, Krillin, and Gohan.
However, Frieza notices that Piccolo's power level is about equal to his own level, leaving Frieza with no choice but to transform again.
This form largely resembles his father, King Cold.
Frieza's 6th Universe counterpart Frost also takes on a second form, however it bears a greater resemblance to Frieza's third form and is said to be the equivalent of it by Piccolo.
Frieza's third form is again more brutish, with an extremely elongated skull (like an Alien).
His facial features contort and change, with his nose melding into his mouth to form a crude beak.
His original horns recede and are now white in color, erupting in pairs along the length of his head.
His tail tip, which had been cut off by Kuririn, did not regenerate and he now has a slight hunch.
Although his tail was surprisingly not regenerated, the rest of his wounds disappeared as if nothing ever touched him.
Drastically differing from his previous transformations, in his final, true form, Frieza's third form (being more like a shell for this final form) cracks and shatters open, revealing a shorter and less bulky appearance.
His horns and spikes disappear with his physique becoming entirely streamlined and his skin is now a pure, solid white with purple sections on his head, shoulders, forearms, chest and shins.
All injuries taken in other forms are healed.
This is the form that allows him to release his full potential.
Frieza is also able to attain 100% power of this form, his muscle mass becoming engorged compared to his previously sleek frame.
This is the peak of Frieza's natural potential, and the maximum amount of power his body can output.
This form gives Frieza enough strength and speed to make even Super Saiyan Goku struggle; however to obtain such power, Frieza's body is subjected to a muscle strain, which slowly lowers his energy, reducing his speed until he cannot compete with Super Saiyan Goku anymore.
This transformation is therefore not suitable for prolonged combat, with Frieza trying to finish the fight as quickly as possible by destroying Planet Namek.
Frieza's 6th Universe counterpart, Frost, also briefly uses this form during the Tournament of Power.
After being cut in half by his own attack and being caught in Namek's huge explosion, what remains of the still-living Frieza is salvaged and rebuilt with cybernetic enhancements by scientists under the order of King Cold; this form is referred to as in video games.
The whole of the lower half of his body and right side of his face are replaced, as is his left arm from the shoulder down, with scarring and metal accoutrements covering what little was left of his organic self.
It is stated that these enhancements have made him even more powerful.
However, he was never able to unleash his full power in this form, since he was quickly destroyed by Trunks.
Frieza attains another transformation in the 2015 film "" and "Dragon Ball Super".
According to Frieza, his fifth transformation is achieved after undergoing intensive training for four months, enabling him to gain the strength to progress even further beyond his previous transformations by drawing out all of his latent power (as he had never trained a day in his life beforehand).
In this form, Frieza's physique is similar to his previous fourth form except his skin is now a golden color as opposed to white, with purple sections on his head, chest, forearms and shins, thus he is known as in this form.
In this form at peak power, Frieza is able to overpower Goku in his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form with relative ease.
This form however, drains his energy much like when he used 100% of his power in his fourth form, due to him not training himself further to become accustomed to the form, and thus is also unsuitable for prolonged combat, as he soon finds himself unable to compete with Goku and Vegeta in their Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan forms.
After his second revival, Frieza reveals he mastered his Golden form due to intense meditation while in hell.
This "True Golden Frieza" can be used indefinitely without any drain on Frieza's stamina or even while he is barely conscious.
Frieza's Japanese voice actor, Ryūsei Nakao jokingly placed Golden Frieza's power level at “one hundred quintillion” (or 1.2 billion times stronger than the Fourth form).
In Dragon Ball Heroes there is a version of Golden Frieza called "Rage Golden Frieza" which is an empowered version of Golden Frieza fuelled by Rage which also appears in Super as well.
In the GT live action stage play, it shows Frieza had gain this transformation alongside Cell who escaped Hell and searching for Goku They easily beat Trunks but Pan tricks them into Searching Goku elsewhere.
In numerous filler episodes of the anime and "Dragon Ball GT", Frieza makes numerous cameo appearances, usually as comic relief, causing trouble in Hell, having somehow been permitted to keep his body despite his wrongdoings.
In Hell, he is defeated and sent to prison by Goku and Pikkon along with Cell, his father and the Ginyu Force, and he is later seen watching Goku's final battle with Majin Buu in a crystal ball, comically hoping for Goku to lose (this appearance is later contradicted in "Resurrection "F"", where Frieza is depicted as unaware that Goku fought and defeated Buu).
In "", Frieza briefly escapes from Hell with an army of villains to attack Earth, but he is swiftly defeated by Gohan.
In "Dragon Ball GT", when Goku is sent to Hell by accident, Frieza and Cell confront him, their bodies having been rendered temporarily immortal due to the unbalance between the two worlds.
Using a joint attack, Frieza and Cell send Goku to a lower level where he is frozen by a witch, but the two villains end up frozen themselves when they foolishly venture downwards to gloat at Goku.
Goku accidentally breaks the ice holding Frieza and Cell and it shatters to pieces, implying that Frieza and Cell have been erased from existence.
However, in a future scene, Frieza and Cell are seen being taken away in a jail cell with tape over their mouths and appear in the live action GT show where he and Cell gained new forms to track down Goku.
He appeared in a TV ad for "", as he makes a non-speaking appearance in the film.
He also appears in a chapter of Toriyama's "Neko Majin" manga, published in August 2003, which also introduces Frieza's son, .
He briefly appears in the 2006 "Dragon Ball" crossover chapter, , of Osamu Akimoto's manga "Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo".
Frieza appears in Naho Ōishi's 2011 "Dragon Ball" spin-off manga "", but it predominately features his ancestor .
He also appears in Toriyama's 2014 "" special.
Frieza has made numerous appearances in other media.
The Japanese nu metal/hardcore punk band Maximum the Hormone released the song "F" as part of a double A-side single on July 9, 2008.
The entirety of the song references Frieza, with the single itself rising as high as number two on the Oricon music chart.
The song was the source of reference used by Toriyama for the title of the film "Fukkatsu no F" and is featured in the movie.
Seikima-II frontman Demon Kakka wrote and performed the song that appeared in two episodes of "Dragon Ball Kai" and on the 2009 "Dragon Ball Kai Song Collection" album.
In the manga "Black Cat", the character Sven Vollfied is often seen using his cell phone with a wrist strap of a miniature-sized badge of Frieza's head.
A caricature of Frieza mixed with a grey alien was parodied as a mech pilot in an episode of "Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi".
The anime "Yakitate!!
Japan" featured a spoof re-enactment of the fight between Goku and Frieza, with a character clad in a refrigerator representing the latter.
The Cartoon Network show "" had a parody of their own of the climactic fight and the Frieza character, with the Delightful Children From Down the Lane portraying him as a multi-headed monstrosity.
Frieza has been featured in many of the video games based on the series.
Often, he's both a playable character and boss, though more frequently the latter.
He is also usually able to transform into his many different forms.
Frieza appears in the Famicom game (and later Playdia remake) "".
Frieza seems to be somehow resurrected, and he and other past villains start attacking Goku and his friends.
Once it's revealed these are merely ghost-warriors meant to distract the heroes, however, the false Frieza and his allies are easily dealt with.
Other games highlight Frieza in alternate story paths; including those where he successfully attains immortality and goes on to threaten Earth such as "", and "" where Frieza and Cell are resurrected and controlled by Bobbidi as a distraction for the player.
Frieza also appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting games "Jump Ultimate Stars", "Battle Stadium D.O.N", and "J-Stars Victory Vs".
In the original Japanese version, Frieza is voiced by Ryūsei Nakao in all media.
In English, Frieza was voiced by Linda Young in the original Funimation dub of "Dragon Ball Z" and all subsequent media up until the first episode of "Dragon Ball Z Kai".
He has since been voiced by Christopher Ayres in all media.
Due to Ayres being diagnosed with end-stage COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and requiring a double lung transplant, he has since been voiced by his understudy Daman Mills.
Following his treatment, Ayres returned to voice Frieza for the film "".
Yū Kondō, Toriyama's second editor from the Saiyan arc until the appearance of Perfect Cell, and Fuyuto Takeda, his third editor from Perfect Cell until the end of the series, said that "Dragon Ball" hit its peak in popularity during the Frieza arc.
In a one-thousand ballot popularity poll held in "Weekly Shōnen Jump", "Dragon Ball" received 815 of them.
In 2004, fans of the series voted Frieza the ninth most popular character for a poll in the book "Dragon Ball Forever".
Frieza was mentioned as one of the "most beloved characters" in an article by "GamePro".
The casting and direction of his English voices has often been criticized over the years, with IGN's Ramsey Isler writing that, coupled with the ambiguous physical features, the "old lady" voice lead to some gender confusion with fans. "The Ledger"'s December 8, 1999, paper, names him as one of the reasons that "Dragon Ball Z" was listed as a violent show for children stating, "In one recent episode, beads of sweat form on the brow of a character named Vegeta, as he is nearly strangled to death by an evil foe named Frieza.
In another, Frieza uses the horns on his head to impale a good guy named Kuririn through the chest."
As well as opinions on his appearance: "Little Gohan is abruptly in the icy metallic grip of one of his arch-nemeses ["sic"], Frieza, a silvery androgynous giant who looks like a cross between the monster in "Alien" and Batman's Mr.
Freeze."
Kidston Island is an uninhabited island in the Bras d'Or Lakes in Baddeck, Nova Scotia.
The island is owned by the Village of Baddeck which leases it to the local Lions Club, which operates the beach on the island and the ferry to the island.
The island features a lifeguarded beach operated by the Lions Club.
The beach features a picnic area, changing rooms and washrooms.
The island is also home to the Kidston Island Lighthouse, an historic property located on the eastern tip of the island.
Kidston island is accessible during the summer months via a 12-passenger ferry operated by the Lions Club.
In 1819, Lt. James Duffus (half pay Naval Officer), whose brother-in-law was Sir Samuel Cunard founder of the Cunard Line of steamships, founded his home on what is now Kidston Island.
Duffus operated a mercantile business on the island, serving people from River Baddeck and Grand Narrows; customers were ferried to the island by canoe.
Duffus died in 1833, and his former assistants operated the business for a little over two years.
In 1836 the executors of his estate in Halifax sent William Kidston to wind up his business.
Kidston met and ended up marrying Margaret Ann Duffus, widow of James Duffus, in 1836 and taking over the business.
The Kidston business was moved to the mainland in 1840.
A lighthouse was built on Kidston Island was built in 1875.
The present lighthouse was built in 1912 and the two stood side-by-side for some time.
Eventually the island came to be owned by the Mersey Paper Company which sold it to the Village of Baddeck in 1959.
Ancestor is a science fiction thriller novel by New York Times bestselling author Scott Sigler.
The novel was released in podcast format in 2006, with it also being released in print via Dragon Moon Press in 2007.
Ancestor was later re-released by Crown Publishing in 2010. "Ancestor" follows PJ Colding as he and his crew are tasked with transporting a team of scientists to a remote snow-covered landscape to finish their project: to recreate the ancestor of all humanity in order to provide life-saving organs that would be compatible with all people.
As a snow storm threatens to trap them on the island, the scientists succeed beyond their wildest expectations.
The result, however, might just bring humanity to extinction.
Critical reception for the 2010 re-release of "Ancestor" has been positive, with Nerdist writing "It’s like Michael Crichton and Stephen King had a fabulous, bouncing baby".
The Guardian criticized the prose and characterisation as "rudimentary" but praised the pacing and denouement.
BookReporter also praised the novel, citing its characters as a highlight.
Of the 2009 print release, HorrorNews.net wrote "I can see how this format was appealing for the more imaginative podcast format – but avid readers who enjoy fast-paced and exciting sci-fi thrillers will be disappointed by the print version of this effort."
The Yorkshire (Woollen District) Electric Tramways operated a tramway service in Dewsbury between 1903 and 1934.
Under the Spen Valley Light Railways Order of 1901 British Electric Traction set up the Yorkshire (Woollen District) Electric Tramways.
The company established a tramway network centred on Dewsbury with branches to Cleckheaton, Birkenshaw, Ravensthorpe, Thornhill and Birstal.
Operations were replaced by the buses of British Electric Traction-owned Yorkshire Woollen District Transport Company.
Services ended on 31 October 1934.
Ellesmeroceras is the type genus for the Ellesmeroceratidae, a family of primitive nautiloid cephalopods, that is characterized by its small, generally compressed, gradually expanded, orthoconic shell, found in Lower Ordovician marine sediments.
The septa are close spaced and the siphuncle is ventral, about 0.2 the diameter of the shell.
Septal necks are typically orthochoanitic (short, straight) but may slant inwardly (loxochoanitic) or reach halfway to the previous septum (hemichoanitic).
Connecting rings are thick.
As common for the Ellesmerocerida, "Ellesmeroceras" has diaphragms within the siphuncle tube.
The type species, "Ellesmeroceras scheii", named by Foeste, 1921, was first found on Ellesmere Island in the Canadian arctic, from whence the genus gets its name.
Ellesmeroceras is one of three straight shelled Ellesmeroceratids, the other two being "Ectenolites" and "Eremoceras".
It differs from "Ectenolites", from which it is probably derived, in being stouter and proportionally wider, and from "Eremoceras" in being more straight overall.
St Nicholas is a Church of England parish church at Moreton, Dorset, England.
It is known for its thirteen windows, engraved by the poet and artist Sir Laurence Whistler.
T. E. Lawrence was buried in the separate churchyard.
St Nicholas' Church is a Grade II* listed building.
The church's dedication was changed in 1490, to St Nicholas having previously been dedicated to St Magnus Martyr.
The church was rebuilt in 1776, reusing medieval foundations and is considered a good example of the early Gothic revival.
The rebuilding was financed by the Frampton family, who lived in the nearby manor house.
The north aisle was added in 1841 and most internal fittings were renewed c1847.
The adventurer T. E. Lawrence ("Lawrence of Arabia"), who died in 1935, is buried in the separate churchyard.
He was a cousin of the Frampton family and had been a frequent visitor to their home, Okers Wood House.
Lawrence's mother arranged with the Framptons to have him buried in their family plot in the separate burial ground of St Nicholas' Church.
Mourners included Winston and Clementine Churchill, E. M. Forster, and Lawrence's youngest brother Arnold.
In 1940, the church suffered a direct hit from a German bomb, and was largely destroyed.
It was rebuilt over the following decade, but the stained glass windows were replaced with plain green glass, which was not liked by the congregation.
Laurence Whistler was commissioned to provide engraved glass replacements, and after making twelve, he offered to make and donate the thirteenth with a design on the theme of Forgiveness featuring Judas.
The offer was declined, but he made the window anyway.
After being displayed in a local museum, it was eventually installed - on the outside of the church (as the artist intended) - in 2014.
The windows are:
Michael Ivanovich Karinski (1840–1917) was a Russian philosopher.
His "Classification of Inferences" (1880) has been called "the most important single work in logical theory that nineteenth-century Russia produced."
Robert Poland Atkinson (16 November 1927 - 4 July 2012) was a bishop in The Episcopal Church, serving in the Episcopal Diocese of West Virginia, until his retirement, and later assisting in the Diocese of Virginia.
Atkinson was born in Washington, D.C. but raised in Martinsburg, West Virginia, where his family moved when he was three.
He graduated the Martinsburg High School, and then from the University of Virginia in 1950, where he was a member of the Kappa Psi fraternity.
Interested in the ministry since his days at the Peterkin conference center, Atkinson then attended the Virginia Theological Seminary and graduated in 1953.
Bishop Robert E.L. Strider ordained Atkinson as a deacon in June 1953 and as a priest in February 1954, as he served at St. Matthew's Episcopal Church in Wheeling, West Virginia (1953-1955).
Rev.
Atkinson served as rector of Christ Church in Fairmont, West Virginia from 1955-1958, when he was called to Trinity Episcopal Church in Huntington, West Virginia (1958-1964).
He then moved to Tennessee to become rector of Calvary Episcopal Church in Memphis (1964-1973).
In 1973, the diocesan convention elected him coadjutor to bishop Wilburn C. Campbell, who announced his impending retirement at the end of 1975.
Presiding Bishop John E. Hines, bishop Campbell and bishop William Evan Sanders of Tennessee consecrated Atkinson as the 687th bishop in the Episcopal Church.
His episcopate began with a controversy, as he had two children in the public schools and was placed on a Kanawha County school textbook committee amidst a violent textbook-banning controversy.
That led to 16 sticks of dynamite being blasted on Halloween, 1974 at the Board of Education building a block from the Diocesan center, as well as to his vilification by some partisans both on the street and in print.
Nonetheless, Atkinson (whom many called Bishop Bob) persisted, and after succeeding Rt.Rev.
Campbell as West Virginia's fifth bishop in January 1976, also became a leading advocate within the Episcopal Church for the ordination of women.
When the General Convention authorized such later in the year, he was among the first to ordain a woman, Rev.
Margaret Phillimore.
In 1980 Rt.Rev.
Atkinson also joined other Anglican bishops protesting the South African government's revocation of bishop Desmond Tutu's passport.
After his retirement from West Virginia in 1989 (and bishop John H. Smith becoming his successor), bishop Atkinson and his wife moved back to Charlottesville, Virginia where one of their daughters lived with he husband and family.
Bishop Atkinson then assisted bishop Peter James Lee in the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia, especially in the Shenandoah Valley and adjacent counties of the Blue Ridge Mountains for five years.
He and Rosemary then moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where their son's family lived.
Bishop Atkinson died July 4, 2012 in Jacksonville.
He was survived by his wife of 59 years, Rosemary, two daughters and a son and many grandchildren.
He is buried at Emmanuel Church in Greenwood, Virginia, whose churchyard looks toward Rockfish Gap, Shenandoah National Park and ultimately West Virginia.
He inspired Joe Massey to write books about the Virginia's colonial and historic churches.

"FIRST" Stronghold was the 2016 FIRST Robotics Competition game.
The game was played by two alliances of up to three teams each, and involves breaching the opponents’ defenses, known as outer work as well as capturing their tower by first firing "boulders" (small foam balls) at it, and then surrounding or scaling the tower using a singular rung on the tower wall.
Points were scored by crossing elements of the tower's outer works, shooting boulders into the opposing tower's five goals in order to lower the tower strength, and by surrounding and scaling the tower.
The name of the game was revealed on October 14, 2015 in a video that was produced with Walt Disney Imagineering.
The details of the game were revealed at the kickoff event on January 9, 2016.
For this competition, the driver stations were split between the tower, with two driver stations to its left and one driver station to its right.
Each team was given the option to display a team standard above the team's driver station.
This standard was a small flag (made out of paper, cloth, or other flexible materials) and held up with a support structure built by the teams.
The Kickoff event was held on January 9, 2016.
The event was filmed at Searles Castle in Windham, New Hampshire and at Southern New Hampshire University in Manchester.
The event was live-streamed on the Internet as well as being presented at regional kickoff events worldwide.
The broadcast was built around a parody of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", reflecting the "storming the castle" theme of "FIRST" Stronghold.
The playing field is divided into red and blue alliance sections, separated by a neutral zone that contains boulders.
Each section contains a courtyard, an area for opposing teams to shoot boulders at the castle goals, a "secret passage" that allows human players to feed boulders to their robots from the human player station, the "outer works", and the tower.
The outer works is the series of five defensive obstacles that divide the neutral zone from the alliance sections and span the field.
Four of the five used obstacles are modular and can be moved, and certain obstacles may or may not be present during a match.
Options for defensive obstacles include a cheval de frise, a "moat", ramparts, a drawbridge, a sally port, a portcullis, a rock wall, and "rough terrain".
The defensive obstacle on the left of each outer works, the "low bar", is not movable.
LED light strips at the base of each obstacle display current obstacle strength.
Three defensive obstacles of the outer works in a particular match are determined by the teams playing the match and one obstacle is chosen by the audience.
There are over 18,000 possible field configurations from the eight defensive options.
After problems with robots and boulders getting stuck in the fabric on the low bar, FIRST made the decision to have it replaced with rubber flaps at some events (including the Championship).
The tower consists of five scoring goals, three scaling rungs, and a "batter".
Three high goals are 7 feet 1 inch above the playing field, and two low goals are six inches above the playing field.
Three rungs for robots to scale the tower are 6 feet 4 inches from the playing field.
Colored LED light strips on the front of the tower display the current tower strength.
The "batter" is a series of seven 60° ramps at the base of the tower directly in front of the low goals designed to make challenging and scaling the tower difficult.
The tower has a health of 8 for regional and district play and a health of 10 at the "FIRST" Championship.
Scoring elements are called boulders, grey foam balls that are 10 inches in diameter.
There are 12 boulders present on the field at the beginning of a match and 18 total.
Six boulders are staged evenly along the mid line of the field, and three boulders are at each human player station and one in each robot.
Stronghold is a medieval tower defense game in which two alliances of up to three teams each compete to score points by breaching the opponent's outer works and capturing the opponent's tower.
Before the match, teams and the audience select defenses to fortify the alliance's outer works.
Teams receive two ranking points in the competition standings for a win, and one ranking point for a tie.
Each match begins with a 15-second autonomous period where robots act on pre-programmed instructions.
The match then transitions to a 2-minute and 15 second teleoperated (tele-op) period, where robots are driven by the drive teams.
Robots begin in the neutral zone with the ability to hold one boulder each.
However, alliances may assign a "spy" robot to start in the opposing alliance's courtyard.
Alliances earn 2 points for reaching the opposing alliance's outer works, and earn 10 points for crossing them.
Any additional defenses a robot crosses in auto will not decrease a defense's strength, or give points to the alliance.
Once across a defense, a robot in autonomous mode can score a high goal for 10 points or low goal for 5 points.
Robots retrieve boulders from either their secret passage or the mid line, overcome opponent defenses, and score goals in their opponent's courtyard.
Robots may transport only one boulder at a time.
Each time a robot crosses an undamaged defense, they receive 5 points.
Robots earn 5 points for scoring a high goal, and 2 points for a low goal.
In the last 20 seconds of the match, robots race to the opposing alliance's tower to either park on the batter, earning them 5 points for a challenge, or hang from the tower's rungs, earning them 15 points for a scale.
There are opportunities to score additional points by completing certain tasks in "FIRST" Stronghold.
This can be done through breaching and or capturing, and will award the alliance either ranking points in the qualification matches or regular points in the playoff matches.
Any time a robot successfully crosses one of the opponent's defenses (whether in autonomous or tele-op), that defense's strength is reduced by 1/2.
The second time a robot crosses the defense, that defense's strength is reduced completely and is considered "damaged".
Once four of the five defenses are damaged, the outer works are considered breached.
A breach is awarded 1 ranking point in qualifications and 20 points in playoffs.
As goals are scored in the opposing alliance's tower, the tower's strength will be lowered.
After 8 goals (high or low), or 10 goals at the World Championships, the tower has no strength and is considered "weakened".
Only a weakened tower can be captured.
To capture a tower, all robots in the alliance must either drive onto the opposing team's batter, or scale the tower.
Once the capture has been declared, the tower will turn to the capturing alliance's color, and their flag will be raised.
For capturing, the alliance receives 1 ranking point in qualifications, and 25 points in the playoffs.
Emmanuel Taiwo Jegede (born June 1943) is a Nigerian poet, storyteller, painter, printmaker and a sculptor (in wood, bronze and ceramic).
He is the father of musician and composer Tunde Jegede.
Jegede was born in Ayegbaju Ekiti, a Yoruba-speaking region of Nigeria.
He undertook an apprenticeship with sculptor Pa Akerejola in Ekiti before going on to the Yaba School of Technology in Lagos, where he studied with Edo sculptor Osagie Osifo.
In 1963 he travelled to the UK, where he attended Willesden College of Technology and Hammersmith College of Arts, studying the decorative arts, interior design, sculpture and bronze casting.
His first exhibition took place in 1968 at the Woodstock Gallery, London.
In 1970, he set up a studio and foundry at Riverside, London.
In 1977, he was among the Black artists and photographers whose work represented the UK at the Second World Festival of Black Arts and African Culture (Festac '77) in Lagos, Nigeria (the others being Winston Branch, Ronald Moody, Mercian Carrena, Armet Francis, Uzo Egonu, Neil Kenlock, Donald Locke, Cyprian Mandala, Ossie Murray, Sue Smock, Lance Watson and Aubrey Williams).
Also in the 1970s, Jegede was artist-in-residence at the Keskidee Centre (the UK's first arts centre for the Black community), where meetings in 1978 led to the founding of an initiative called the Rainbow Art Group (members included Indira Ariyanayagam, Uzo Egonu, Lancelot Ribeiro, Errol Lloyd, Yeshwant Mali, Gordon V. de La Mothe, Durlabh Singh, Suresh Vedak, Ibrahim Wagh, and Mohammad Zakir, as well as Jegede) that mounted its first exhibition the following year — "Paintings and Sculptures" at Action Space, London.
Among other exhibitions that included Jegede's work were "Afro-Caribbean Art" (27 April – 25 May 1978 at the Artists Market, London), organised by Drum Arts Centre, and "Transforming the Crown: African, Asian and Caribbean Artists in Britain 1966 - 1996", curated by the Caribbean Cultural Center, New York City, in 1997–98.
Most recently, Jegede's work features in the 2015 exhibition "" at the Guildhall Art Gallery, City of London, which is inspired by the papers held at London Metropolitan Archives of Jessica Huntley and Eric Huntley and the publishing company they founded, Bogle-L'Ouverture Publications.
Taylor Leier (born February 15, 1994) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player who currently plays for the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League while under contract to the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL).
He was drafted in the fourth round, 117th overall, at the 2012 NHL Entry Draft by the Philadelphia Flyers.
Leier began his major junior hockey career in the Western Hockey League with the Portland Winterhawks who drafted him 24th overall in the 2009 WHL Bantam Draft.
While playing with the Winterhawks, Leier was drafted 117th overall by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft.
Leier signed a three-year entry-level contract with the Flyers on September 9, 2013.
He made his NHL debut against the Carolina Hurricanes on November 14, 2015.
During the 2016–17 season, Leier scored his first NHL goal with the Flyers on December 17, 2016 against the Dallas Stars.
He was later returned back to the Phantoms and represented Lehigh Valley at the 2017 AHL All-Star Game where he was awarded MVP of the game.
In July 2017, he signed a 1 year, two-way, $807,000 contract extension with the Flyers.
On July 15, 2018, after Leier applied for arbitration, he signed a one year deal with the Flyers worth $720,000.
After attending Flyers training camp prior to the 2018–19 season, Leier was a late roster cut and was loaned to the Phantoms on October 2.
Leier grew up in Saskatchewan with parents Tim and Cindy Leier and younger brother Keaton.
Keaton is a professional ballet dancer with the Atlanta Ballet.
Giovanni Matteo Faà di Bruno (fl. c. 1570, also Horatio or Orazio di Faà) was an Italian nobleman, member of the Faà di Bruno family in the Casale Monferrato region.
A musician of some importance in his lifetime, he composed a limited number of sacred and secular works, most notably two books of madrigals and a set of vespers.
His affiliation with the ducal family of the Gonzagas is evident in the dedicatory prefaces to his books of madrigals; the first dedicated to Guglielmo Gonzaga and the second to his son and heir to the ducal throne Vincenzo.
Andrea Botta, "maestro di cappella" of the cathedral at Casale, who compiled the second edition of the first book, mentions in its preface a publication of Faà's Vespers (now thought to be "Salmi di David" (1573)); besides a setting of the vespers, it contains several motets (for as many as eight voices), as well as a setting of the "Magnificat".
Nicolaas Samuelszoon Kruik (; 2 December 1678, West-Vlieland – 5 February 1754, Spaarndam), also known as Klaas Kruik and Nicolaes Krukius, was a Dutch land surveyor, cartographer, astronomer and weatherman.
He is remembered most today for the Museum De Cruquius bearing his name.
He was a perfectionist who liked to measure things and he calculated temperature measurements in Fahrenheit from 1706 to 1734.
His historical calculations are still used today by the KNMI, the Dutch meteorological institute.
He not only measured weather changes in wind speed, rainfall, air pressure, temperature, and humidity, but also measured sea level.
His method of visualising planes of water level to illustrate contours of depth (isobaths) in his map of the Merwede (1728) was the first of its kind.
He was an advocate of pumping out the Haarlemmermeer (Haarlem lake), which was done a century after his death.
He became a surveyor at the age of 19 and began to draw maps, a lucrative job in his day.
Though born in Vlieland, he moved to Delft a few years after he was born and it is there in 1705 that he started his first weather observations.
In 1717 at the age of 39, though firmly established as a respected surveyor, he moved to the family farm in Rijnsburg outside Leiden and chose to study in Leiden under Herman Boerhaave, at that time the most famous scientist in the Netherlands.
He signed himself in as "Krukius, medical student, born in Delft".
Thanks to Boerhaave, Kruik became a member of the Royal Society of London.
The secretary of the Royal Society at that time, James Jurin, started the first European network of meteorological weather stations, and the Dutch members played a large part.
Kruik was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1724.
In 1721 and 1723 Luigi Ferdinando Marsigli travelled to Holland and he and Boerhaave stimulated Kruik to keep systematic observations in the belief that climate changes had an effect on public health.
Kruik started to travel the various beaches and rivers in the Netherlands and study the waterlevels while continuing his mapmaking work.
On these trips he was sometimes accompanied by Boerhaave and Marsigli.
While studying the Merwede, he began to form plans to help keep the lower areas of the Netherlands dry.
It was at this time that Kruik changed his name to the Latin "Cruquius" after his first publications of maps and measurements.
In 1725 he wrote a famous letter to Willem 's Gravesande, a Dutch professor of physics and astronomy at Leiden, proposing an empirical deductive research method to solve the water problems of the Netherlands.
This letter started the chain of events in working that eventually led to a plan presented to the United Provinces to create a water defence plan in 1727.
It was this unified water plan that in turn led to the creation of Haarlemmermeer bij pumping the Haarlem lake dry more than a century later.
In 1733 he became a member of the 'Hoogheemraadschap Rijnland', the Dutch Waterboard Agency, and worked as a Waterboard inspector in Spaarndam.
It was here that he met Jan Noppen (1706–1734), the Halfweg inspector, who started the earliest continuous weatherstation in Zwanenburg with measurements 3 times daily of temperature, air pressure, humidity, and rainfall.
An eccentric man, Kruik wrote music, and had an obsessive need to measure things.
This need included measuring his own weight and amount of urine daily.
According to contemporary accounts, only Boerhaave could successfully work with him.
J.S.S.
College is a college in Karnataka, India.
The college is situated in picturesque surroundings on the top of the Mailarling Hill, now called Vidyagiri, above sea level, on the outskirts of Dharwad, on the Poona-Bangalore Road.
The college accommodates a school and its hostels, a post office and a bank.
The whole campus measures about and 27 gunthas.
Janata Shikshana Samiti has a network of education and nation-building institutions on the Vidyagiri Campus, like an Arts, Commerce and Science College, a Polytechnic Institute, an Economic Research Institute and the Law College at Hubli.
The Samiti campus has 40 quarters on the campus for its employees.
There are two boys' hostels, a girls' hostel, and a working women's hostel.
There is a library housed in a building constructed with UGC aid.
The J.S.S.
Banashankari Arts, Commerce and Shantikumar Gubbi Science College, was started in 1944 by the Karnataka Education Board with 40 students.
It was taken over by the late Shri R.S.
Hukkerikar, the veteran freedom fighter, constructive worker and educationist in 1952.
It was started as an intermediate college but the science wing was added in 1949.
With the increasing student strength, the college was bifurcated into the Banashankari Arts College and S.K.
Gubbi Science College in 1966.
The two colleges were once again amalgamated in June 1975.
After taking over the management of Janata Shikshana Samiti on 18 October 1973 by Pujya Shri Vishweshateertha Sripadangalavaru of Pejavarmath and Pujya Dr. D. Veerendra Heggade, dharmadhikari of Sri Kshetra Dharmasthala, the new management added a two-year P.U. job-oriented diploma course and Commerce section to the college in 1975 and 1977 respectively.
The college is affiliated to Karnataka University and teaches courses leading to a B.A. degree in Kannada, Sanskrit, Marathi English, Economics, Sociology, Political Science, History, Geography, Hindi, and Education as optional subjects.
It has a commerce wing and on the science side the college provides B.Sc. degree courses in Chemistry, Physics, Botany, Zoology, Statistics, Electronics, Mathematics as optional subjects.
Principals include such illustrious names as Prof. B.M.
Shrikantaiah, the poet and freedom fighter, Prof. G.B.
Jathar the economist, G. A. Kulkarni, a Marathi writer and Sahitya Academy Award recipient, Dr. Karamachand Wade, Dr. R. Y. Dharwadkar, the writer and educationist, Dr. V. G.Kulkarni an orator and educationist, Prof. N. Vajra Kumar the present Principal of the College represents the J.S.S. institutions on Governing Body as Secretary.
The institution carried out several experiments including an earn-while-you-learn programme.
Besides having a library, the college has two NCC companies, two units of NSS and a student welfare unit.
The students are awarded scholarships including studentships, government free ships, concessions under government schemes and other prizes instituted by the college and benevolent donors.
The Management of Janata Shikshana Samiti instituted 57 scholarships of the value of Rs. 100 /- each to encourage merited students and sportsmen.
Banashankari Arts and Commerce and Shantikumar Gubbi Science College is popularly known as J. S. S. or Janata Shikshana Samiti College after the name of the Trust that now runs it.
It has been declared a Lead College by the Commissioner of Collegiate Education, Karnataka.
Affiliated to Karnataka University, Dharwad, it saw its inception in 1944 under the Karnataka Education Board as an intermediate college, its science wing being added in 1949.
Increase in the student population compelled its management to split it into two colleges—Banashankari Arts and S. K. Gubbi Science in 1966.
They were merged again in 1975 to form a single entity.
The college came under a new management, that of the J. S. S. in 1973.
The Banashankari Arts and Commerce and S.K.
Gubbi Science College, Dharwad, is managed by the Janata Shikshana Samiti that has another 20 institutions under its umbrella.
This Samiti, in its turn, is a socially committed service providing front of the Shrikshetra Dharmasthala, said to be the Tirupati of Karnataka State.
The top level management which includes the President, the Chairman and the Board of Management is the main policy-making body controlling and monitoring the activities of the College.
This is followed by the Governing Council which takes care of the academic and infrastructure development, admission policy, students’ welfare schemes etc.
The Principal is the academic and administrative head of the college, who looks after the day-to-day administration.
She is assisted by the HoDs in academic matters and the Internal Quality-Assurance Cell (IQAC) in extra-curricular activities.
There are committees for different activities.
Appraisal of the financial transaction is done by the Internal Auditor, who is an employee of the institution and then by a qualified external auditor independently.
The college in 2004-5 had 1,398 students, of which 785 were male and 613 female.
Unit cost of expenditure per student was Rs. 10, 821.00, as given by the college, which includes the students of the PUC, which, the PT feels, should have been left out of this account.
College sports activities include athletics, basketball, table tennis, cricket, volleyball, and softball.
There are playgrounds and space for indoor games and recreational facilities.
It has five hostels, two for boys and three for girls, these having 582 (252+330) seats in all.
I Epomeni Kinisi is a Greek album by singer Anna Vissi released in Greece and Cyprus in 1986 by CBS Greece.
This album is all written by Nikos Karvelas.
In spite of her previous albums, it featured a clear pop sound, very distinctive of Vissi's next albums.
The album reached platinum status and was one of the best-selling albums of 1987 in Greece.
As the two number one singles from the previous album "Kati Simveni" were written by Karvelas, her label accepted Vissi's suggestion for the next album to be written entirely by Karvelas.
The result was a pop album with 10 songs.
Notable is the fact that this is the first album CBS Greece released on CD, simultaneously with the original vinyl release, though it was re-released in 1996.
Music and lyrics on the album are by Nikos Karvelas.
Anna Vissi and Giorgos Mitsigas contributed as the lyricists of two songs.
When the album was released in a CD in 1986 it featured five tracks as bonus tracks from the album "Kati Simveni" The track list was as follows: Personnel Production Design Credits adapted from the album's liner notes.

"Portsmouth" is a traditional English folk dance tune, similar to an Irish or Scottish hornpipe melody.
It is sometimes referred to as the "Portsmouth Hornpipe". "Portsmouth" appeared in the 11th edition of John Playford's "The Dancing Master" in 1701.
It is also one of the three arrangements on which English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams based his "Sea Songs", originally arranged for military band in 1923 as the second movement of his "English Folk Song Suite", and subsequently re-arranged for full orchestra in 1942 by the composer.
In the 1950s it was used as the signature tune for BBC television series "Billy Bunter".
Popular musician Mike Oldfield recorded an arrangement of the instrumental in 1976.
Released as a single, it is Oldfield's highest charting single in the United Kingdom, where it reached number three.
In an attempt to repeat the success of his previous year's Christmas hit, "In Dulci Jubilo", Mike recorded another traditional folk melody dating from 1701 (first known publication), again using Leslie Penning on recorders.
The single was just as successful as its predecessor, charting at number 3 in the UK, and became his first non-album single to be issued in the USA.
It also charted at number 2 in Ireland, and was Oldfield's highest charting single there until 1983's "Moonlight Shadow", which spent a week at number 1 in Ireland.
Mike Oldfield plays acoustic guitar, accordion, mandolin, ARP string synthesiser, tambourine, kettle drum and bodhran (Irish drum), and both Oldfield and Penning are credited with "feet".
This song, plus two others chosen as the B-side in different countries, had been released the month before as three of four new songs on the compilation album "Boxed".
They were mixed and encoded for SQ quadraphonic sound, the only format this album was issued in, and all issues of these songs in vinyl and tape formats have the encoding, even if they only say "stereo" on the label, as do all single releases. "Argiers" is another traditional folk song, performed by Leslie Penning on recorders and Mike Oldfield on acoustic guitar and ARP string synthesiser.
An unusual feature of this arrangement is that it is in a minor key, having been converted from its original major key via diatonic transposition. "Portsmouth" and "Argiers" were both recorded in January 1976 at Througham, Gloucestershire, Mike's new home studio, shortly after he moved from his previous home in Hergest Ridge, which was the location of his previous home studio, the Beacon.
"Speak (Tho' You Only Say Farewell)" is an old show tune performed by David Bedford on piano and vocals, and Mike Oldfield on vocals.
It is similar in style to Bedford's earlier work in the Coxhill-Bedford Duo with Lol Coxhill, and was recorded at the Beacon in November 1974.
The piece is featured on the Mercury Records reissue of "Ommadawn", released on 7 June 2010.
Issued in USA, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland, Yugoslavia, Australia and South Africa.
Each central European country issued it in a cover unique to their country.
Ireland issued both pairings, and some copies of both editions exist mis-pressed with the B-side label belonging to the other edition.
The single has been issued three times in France, in 1976, 1977, and 1980, each with different sleeves.
A music video was made for this song, and can be found on the DVD, "Elements – The Best of Mike Oldfield".
Shot in Oldfield's Througham studio, it shows four female folk dancers who dance barefoot around the studio, while Oldfield is seen playing various instruments.
As in the video for his previous single, "In Dulci Jubilo", the video emphasizes that Oldfield plays all the instruments, even though this is not strictly true.
The piece was featured in the 1979 NASA documentary film by Tony Palmer, "The Space Movie".
It also featured during the series 'I'm Alan Partridge".
The piece has become synonymous with English football club, Portsmouth F.C., who play the tune before games at their home stadium, Fratton Park.
Notably it was played during their victorious FA Cup 2008 campaign, including after the final game against Cardiff City on 17 May 2008 at Wembley.
In April 2010 two groups were set up on the social networking site Facebook to encourage people to download the single "Portsmouth" via sites such as iTunes in the week commencing 3 May 2010, in a hope to get into the UK Singles Chart, before Portsmouth F.C. 's FA Cup Final appearance against Chelsea.
Oldfield himself commented on the campaign.
It however did not chart.
The white-striped woodcreeper ("Lepidocolaptes leucogaster") is a species of bird in the Dendrocolaptinae subfamily.
It is endemic to Mexico.
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.
The album consist of two previously released singles.
Sunao ni Ienakute and Itsuka wa are the songs composed by their vocalist, Izumi Sakai.
In 2009, the song Sunao ni Ienakute was re-arranged and released as single, where arranger positions were changed by member of Japanese band Garnet Crow, Hitoshi Okamoto.
Mai Kuraki has joined in the chorus parts.
The album reached #36 rank first week.
It charted for 57 weeks and completely sold 333,000 copies.

Erected in 1927, the Diamond War Memorial is located on The Diamond in the centre of Derry, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
It is dedicated to the citizens of the city who lost their lives while in military service during World War I.
In early 1919, the public leaders of the city of Derry first considered initiating a fund to erect a memorial to the fallen of the Great War.
The memorial would be composed of granite or bronze and would have the names of the deceased inscribed upon it.
The City War Memorial Fund was established in February 1919.
It required several years to obtain the necessary funding from charitable contributions.
By the sixth anniversary of the 1918 Armistice, some Derry citizens became disgruntled by the slow progress.
However, the following year, in April 1925, the design and location of the memorial were approved by the city's War Memorial Committee.
However, they still faced the hurdle of obtaining consent from the Londonderry Corporation, which was obtained after some initial disagreement with regard to the proposed location of the monument.
The Diamond War Memorial was designed by siblings Sydney March and Vernon March.
The brothers came from a large family that included eight children who became artists and established a studio at their family home of Goddendene in Farnborough, Kent, England.
The monument was sculpted by one of the brothers, Vernon March, who, together with his siblings, was also responsible for monuments such as the National War Memorial of Ottawa.
Vernon was considered to be a prodigy, with the distinction of being the youngest exhibitor in the Royal Academy of Arts, having been just 16 years old when his statue of Psyche was shown and purchased on the third day of the exhibition.
Vernon March also sculpted miniatures of the Diamond War Memorial that are housed within Saint Columb's Cathedral in Derry.
The Memorial is of bronze and Portland stone, a limestone mined from the quarries of the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England.
The memorial has a height of almost forty feet and a width of twenty-seven feet.
A centre monument, including a winged victory statue holding high a laurel wreath, has the names of the fallen engraved in raised letters on four sides.
Near the base of the memorial, there are two smaller bronze monuments, a soldier on one side representing the Army and a sailor on the other side representing the Navy.
The walled city of Derry, nicknamed the Maiden City, has four main gates, with roads that lead to a central Diamond, the heart of the city.
The cenotaph is located in the centre of The Diamond.
The design of the memorial is similar to that of the Cenotaph erected in Cape Town, South Africa in 1924, which was also designed by March.
The ceremonial unveiling of the Diamond War Memorial took place on 23 June 1927.
Major-General F. F. Ready, General Officer Commanding the Northern Ireland district, performed the unveiling.
Sir Robert Newton Anderson, chairman of the War Memorial Committee, as well as member of the Northern Ireland House of Commons and former mayor of the city, had been scheduled to preside over the ceremony, but illness prevented his attendance that day.
There were places of honour for relatives, servicemen's associations, former regiments, the United Kingdom's forces, clergy, and representatives of public bodies.
The British Legion served as honour guard, and the band of the 1st Battalion and a large choir also participated.
After an initial music program, Major-General Ready, accompanied by the mayor and town clerk, proceeded to the memorial, where there was an inspection of the honour guard.
Following singing of "God of Our Fathers, Known of Old", originally written by Rudyard Kipling as the poem "Recessional", Lady Anderson, acting on behalf of her husband, gave a short speech and then requested that the major-general proceed with the unveiling and dedication.
Ready delivered a brief address and unveiled the memorial.
After the dedication of the monument, a brief period of silence was observed, followed by the hymn "The Supreme Sacrifice", also known as "O Valiant Hearts", written by Sir John Stanhope Arkwright and composed by Rev.
C. Harris.
The buglers of the 1st battalion played "The Last Post" and "Londonderry Air".
Lady Anderson, representing her husband and the War Memorial Committee, handed over custody of the memorial to the mayor, who accepted on behalf of the Londonderry Corporation.
Wreaths were also placed on the monument on behalf of the citizens, the Northern Ireland District, and the British Legion.
After the national anthem, floral tributes were placed by representatives of relatives, former units, regimental associations, and public bodies.
The dedication of the monument that was erected in honour of the 756 citizens of their city killed in World War I, as well as the 4,000 men and women who volunteered for duty, then concluded.
The Holywell Trust, formed in 1988, is a charitable organisation based in the centre of the walled city of Derry.
It has an aim of researching and promoting awareness in the North West of Ulster (County Londonderry, County Donegal, and County Tyrone) of World War I memorials, as well as the citizens who died in the war.
The trust initiated the Diamond War Memorial Project on 12 February 2007.
It entailed extensive research by historian Trevor Temple of the 756 names on the Diamond War Memorial.
The project also led to the creation of a Commemorative Diary and a website which lists the names of those on the memorial and details their individual stories.
The project research discovered an almost equal proportion of unionist and nationalist names, such that the Diamond War Memorial may be considered a shared monument by its citizens.
Nepenthes robcantleyi, or Robert Cantley's pitcher plant, is a tropical pitcher plant endemic to the Philippine island of Mindanao.
It is closely allied to "N. truncata" and was once considered a dark, highland form of this species. "Nepenthes veitchii" from Borneo is also thought to be a close relative.
The pitchers of "N. robcantleyi" are exceptionally large, reaching 40 cm in length by 10 cm in width.
The inflorescence, at up to 2.5 m long, is the tallest among known "Nepenthes" species.
The plant itself does not grow very tall, however, and is not known to climb.
The specific epithet "robcantleyi" honours Robert Cantley, who was involved in the plant's discovery, propagation, and introduction to cultivation. "Nepenthes robcantleyi" was discovered by Robert Cantley in January 1997, on a remote mountain on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines.
Cantley was exploring the site in search of "N. truncata" seeds for his recently established plant nursery, Borneo Exotics.
The site lay within a logging concession and Cantley was accompanied by the head of security for the company with the logging rights to the area.
Near the top of a small hill Cantley found a number of typical "N. truncata" plants as well as two mature individuals of a striking, previously unknown taxon.
Though bearing very dark pitchers with well-developed wings and a wide, flared peristome, the plants closely matched "N. truncata" in leaf morphology and were at the time assumed to represent a robust highland variant of this species.
One of these plants bore a mature infructescence that had already dispersed "nearly all" of its seeds.
Cantley collected the few remaining seeds from this plant.
The darker of the two plants—which later became known as the "black "N. truncata"" on account of its almost completely black pitchers—was growing in full sun and measured around 1.5 m in diameter, being "not yet mature".
The original population discovered by Cantley is now thought to be extinct, as the area was cleared shortly after Cantley's visit (in 1997) and two trips in the subsequent two years failed to find any surviving plants.
The seeds collected by Cantley were successfully germinated in cultivation.
The resulting plants closely matched the two individuals seen in the wild in both their morphology and dark pigmentation (though they exhibited some variation in peristome colour).
Initially thought to represent an extreme variant of "N. truncata", they were presented as such on the Borneo Exotics website.
Martin Cheek's describing paper states that only 9 plants were raised from the original batch of seeds.
Cantley subsequently clarified that there were in fact 11 plants: 4 were sent to a grower in the United States (Tony Paroubek), 1 to a grower in Japan (Shinya Yamada), and 6 remained at Borneo Exotics.
Of the four US plants, two were later stolen and one of the remaining two grew for only a short time before dying; this latter specimen may have been of hybrid origin.
The six Borneo Exotics plants form a "Royal family" that includes the 'Queen of Hearts', 'King of Clubs', "Nepenthes robcantleyi", and particularly the 'Queen of Hearts' plant, has featured prominently in the company's Gold Medal-winning Chelsea Flower Show displays.
It has also appeared at other shows, including the Singapore Garden Festival in 2008.
The species is reported to be an easy grower and to do well in typical "Nepenthes" highland conditions, with warm days up to 25 °C, cool nights down to 12 °C, and high light levels.
Providing adequate conditions are maintained, a pitcher-to-leaf size ratio greater than 1 can be achieved in cultivation.
A number of horticultural hybrids involving "N. robcantleyi" have been produced. "Nepenthes robcantleyi" was formally described by Kew botanist Martin Cheek in the "Nordic Journal of Botany".
An independently paginated preprint of the type description was distributed on 2 December 2011, but the journal number in which it appeared was only issued on 6 January 2012 (though dated "2011").
For the purposes of priority the year of valid publication is recorded as 2011.
The specific epithet "robcantleyi" was chosen to honour Robert Cantley.
The shorter epithet "cantleyi" (also referring to Robert Cantley) had previously been applied to a natural hybrid between "N. bicalcarata" and "N. gracilis" ("N. × cantleyi").
Though this name has never been validly published (it is a "nomen nudum") and was therefore available for describing a new species, Cheek chose "robcantleyi" instead to avoid confusion between the two.
The herbarium specimen "Cheek 15877" is the designated holotype and is deposited at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (K) in London, England.
An isotype is held at the Philippine National Herbarium (PNH) in Manila, the Philippines. "Cheek 15877" was prepared on 15 June 2010, and originates from cultivated material that was grown from wild seed originally collected by Cantley in 1997.
This herbarium material was prepared from the 'Queen of Hearts' plant, which was supplied by Cantley.
Cantley also supplied Cheek with closeup photographs of the other mature specimens in his possession, and a photographic record from January 1997 (showing the original wild plants) is deposited alongside the herbarium material.
Wild plants resembling "N. robcantleyi" were found by Andy Smith and colleagues in 2011, but due to their epiphytic habit they could only be photographed at a distance.
Smith managed to relocate the plants in 2013, and this time he was able to examine them more closely, showing that they were morphologically similar to "N. robcantleyi" and possibly conspecific with it.
In 2012, Wally Suarez encountered similar plants at an unspecified locality in Mindanao.
Like those found by Andy Smith, these plants grew exclusively as epiphytes. "Nepenthes robcantleyi" is a shrub growing to a height of 0.5–1 m; no climbing specimens have been recorded.
The stem is terete and reaches around 2 cm in diameter in mature plants, with internodes 1.5–2.5 cm long.
The short internodal length means that each leaf base forms a slight sheath around the one immediately above it.
Axillary buds are inconspicuous.
Leaves are thick and robust, with a coriaceous (leathery) texture, and possess a distinct petiole.
Laminae (leaf blades) borne on short stems are oblong-elliptic and measure up to 28.5 by 26.5 cm.
The laminar apex is both truncate and acuminate, the acumen continuing for 2–3 cm down the tendril and being similarly wide.
The tendril attachment is not peltate.
The laminar base is cordate with a sinus 2.1–3.2 cm deep.
The petiole is highly pronounced and very long, reaching 23 cm in length.
It varies in width from 0.8–1.0 cm near the lamina to 2 cm in its basal portion.
It is canaliculate with wings that fold over the adaxial channel; this gives the petiole its terete appearance.
The base of the petiole forms a sheath that surrounds the stem for three-fifths of its circumference and 3–5 cm of its length.
Two to four prominent longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib.
Pinnate veins are inconspicuous.
Tendrils are thick (≤7 mm in diameter) and uncoiled, even when produced on higher parts of the stem.
True rosette or lower pitchers are only produced for a brief period before the plant begins developing mature traps (termed "intermediate pitchers" in the type description).
These mature pitchers can be very large: up to 33.0 cm high by 9.5 cm wide.
They are broadly cylindrical throughout, being widest near the base (≤9 cm) and narrowing slightly below the peristome (≤8.5 cm).
A pair of wings around 10 mm wide runs down the ventral surface of the pitcher cup.
These wings bear filiform fringe elements 10–12 mm long, spaced 3–4 mm apart.
The pitcher mouth is obcordate in shape and has a more-or-less oblique insertion, being horizontal at the front, rising slightly by 1 cm (rarely up to 3 cm) in the central portion, and rising abruptly at the rear to form a tall neck that curves forward, giving the mouth a concave appearance when viewed from the side.
The top of the neck stands around 12 cm above the front of the mouth.
The peristome of this species is very well developed and showy.
It is gently curved in cross section and has a somewhat wavy outer margin.
The peristome may be flattened (as in the 'Queen of Hearts' plant) but is often folded back in mature pitchers.
It varies in width from approximately 2 cm at the front, up to 5 cm in the central portion, and expanding to 6–9 cm or even 10 cm at the rear, making it one of the broadest in the genus.
The neck extends for around 4 cm beyond this expanded portion of the peristome.
The peristome bears ribs 1.0–1.5 mm high, spaced around 1.5 mm apart.
These terminate in teeth on the peristome's inner margin.
The teeth are generally 3–4 mm long, with those of the central seam being slightly smaller ( 2 mm long) and splayed forward at an angle of around 45°.
The pitcher lid or operculum is broadly ovate to suborbicular and up to around 9.5 cm in both width and length.
It is held more-or-less horizontally on a cylindrical stipe measuring around 5 mm by 3 mm.
It has a rounded apex and a base that is first shallowly and then abruptly cordate, with a sinus 2 cm wide and 5–8 mm deep.
A prominent basal appendage is present on the underside of the lid.
It is laterally-flattened, approximately semicircular, and around 13 mm long by 4 mm high.
It emanates from a keel (3–5 mm high) that runs along the midline of the lower lid surface for around 2.5 cm.
This keel continues as a "raised midrib" and ends in a second appendage around 7 mm from the lid apex.
This apical appendage is cylindrical and much smaller than the basal projection, measuring around 3 mm in width by around 2 mm in height.
The larger basal appendage is set within a concavity that appears as a bulge on the upper surface of the lid.
This ovate boss is around 4 cm by 3  cm and rises up to 1 cm above the rest of the lid.
Strengthened by the underlying keel, it forms a rather rigid structure.
Its concave lower surface houses a dense concentration of larger nectar glands, which are otherwise absent from the lid.
Those glands within 5 mm of the basal appendage are domed, orbicular, and 0.15 mm in diameter.
Those occupying the remainder of the boss are transversely elliptic and 0.5 mm by 0.3 mm wide.
The area of the lower lid surface outside the boss also bears glands, but these are much smaller (~0.05 mm in diameter) and sparsely distributed.
They have the appearance of "red depressed globose glands".
A well-developed spur is inserted near the base of the lid.
It is entire (smooth and unbranched) and stout, with a truncate-concave apex.
It measures up to 12 mm in length, with a diameter of up to 1.5 mm.
True upper pitchers—those having coiled tendrils and lacking fringed wings—are apparently not produced by this species. "Nepenthes robcantleyi" has a racemose inflorescence bearing two-flowered partial peduncles.
The male inflorescence of "N. robcantleyi" is the tallest among known "Nepenthes" species and possibly among all carnivorous plants.
It measures up to 2.13 m in length, of which the peduncle constitutes up to 97 cm.
The rachis bears 100–130 two-flowered partial peduncles, spaced 6–8 mm (rarely as little as 0 mm) apart.
The partial peduncles lack bracts and have a basal length of 5–12 mm, before forking into a pair of pedicels 30–36 mm long.
Tepals are elliptic and measure 4–6 mm by 3–4 mm.
The androphore is 5–6 mm long and terminates in a bright yellow anther head measuring 1–2 mm by 2–3 mm.
As in many species, the male flowers undergo a colour change associated with anthesis; tepals are initially green with a red base, turning purple with age, whereas the androphore changes from dull red to bright red during the same period.
The female inflorescence is somewhat shorter, though still very large at up to 140 cm long.
As in male plants, the peduncle is up to 97 cm long.
Flowers are far more sparsely distributed, with only around 35 partial peduncles per inflorescence.
The partial peduncles are two-flowered and usually spaced 17–55 mm apart, but sometimes they may be very close or even touching.
They are 19–28 mm long with pedicels 20–33 mm long.
The partial peduncles bear basal bracts inserted 4–10 mm above the attachment point to the rachis.
These bracts are filiform-linear, patent-reflexed, and 4–6 mm long, becoming longer towards the base of the inflorescence.
Tepals are oblong-elliptic, patent-reflexed, and, unlike those of male flowers, are a dull pale green.
They measure 6–8 mm by 3–4 mm and become elongated with age.
The ovary is ellipsoidal and measures around 3 mm by 9 mm.
Mature fruits and seeds were not included in the type description as they had not been seen by the author. "Nepenthes robcantleyi" bears a variable indumentum of short, reddish-brown, dendritic hairs around 0.5 mm long.
These are sparsely distributed on the lower surface of the lamina and upper part of the pitcher, and very sparsely on the inflorescence, but form a dense covering on developing leaves.
The pitcher body is a rich reddish-brown to almost black, sometimes with green wings.
The peristome is similarly dark, usually a uniform reddish-brown or black except for the pale green inner margin.
The upper surface of the lid also ranges from dark red to black.
The underside of the lid is pale green along the midline and near the basal appendage, and bright green to dark red towards the margins.
The pitcher interior, as seen through the mouth, is bright green with purple blotches.
The pitchers of this species generally have a glossy appearance. "Nepenthes robcantleyi" is known with certainty only from the single location in Mindanao, the Philippines, where it was observed in 1997.
This location has not been disclosed for conservation reasons.
The plants originally observed by Cantley grew at an altitude of around 1800 m above sea level in "submontane evergreen forest".
Though these plants grew terrestrially, the species is also likely to occur as an epiphyte, like its close relative "N. truncata".
The plants found by Andy Smith and Wally Suarez, which may be conspecific with "N. robcantleyi", also grew epiphytically.
The plants observed in 1997 were sympatric with an "unusual and giant form" of "N. alata" "sensu lato".
In the type description Martin Cheek informally assessed the conservation status of "N. robcantleyi" as Critically Endangered based on the IUCN criteria, while noting that the species may already be extinct in the wild.
On account of its vegetative and floral features—specifically the racemose inflorescence, pronounced petioles, flattened and expanded peristome, and basal and apical lid appendages—"N. robcantleyi" is placed in the infrageneric "Regiae", a group introduced by B. H. Danser in his 1928 monograph, "The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies".
This group reaches its greatest diversity on the island of Borneo, where around 12 species are currently recognised. "Nepenthes robcantleyi" and "N. truncata" are the only "Regiae" species known from the Philippines.
"Nepenthes robcantleyi" shows close affinities to "N. truncata", from which it differs in several aspects of pitcher morphology. "Nepenthes robcantleyi" retains fringed wings in its mature (largest) pitchers, while in "N. truncata" these are reduced to fringe-less ridges around 1 mm wide.
The peristome is another distinguishing feature: in "N. robcantleyi" it is variably flattened and 6 to even 10 cm wide at the rear, compared to only 2 cm in "N. truncata", whose peristome is rounded and semi-circular in section.
The peristome ribs of "N. robcantleyi" are described as "wing-like" in section and reach a much greater level of development than in "N. truncata": they are 1–1.5 mm high and spaced 1–2 mm apart.
The far less conspicuous ribs of "N. truncata" (which are cylindric in section) lie closely packed together, with no obvious separation between each rib.
In describing "N. robcantleyi", Martin Cheek considered it to be closer to "N. veitchii" of Borneo, writing: "Many of the characters that separate "N. robcantleyi" from "N. truncata" are those that have defined "N. veitchii"."
He distinguished these two species on the basis of pitcher morphology and indumentum development.
In "N. robcantleyi" the shape of the pitcher lid ranges from broadly ovate to suborbicular, compared to oblong in "N. veitchii".
The basal lid appendage is more pronounced in "N. robcantleyi", always being clearly distinguishable from the keel.
It also differs in shape, being semi-circular instead of slightly convex.
Whereas in "N. robcantleyi" the nectar glands of the lower lid surface are densely concentrated around the basal appendage and largely absent from other parts, those of "N. veitchii" are sparsely distributed over the entire lid underside.
In "N. robcantleyi" the upper surface of the lid is also distinct in that it bears an ovate boss measuring around 4 cm by 3 cm; this structure is not found in "N. veitchii".
Perhaps the most obvious means of distinguishing between the two species lies in the hairs covering their vegetative parts. "Nepenthes robcantleyi" is for the most part glabrous, having a glossy appearance.
"Nepenthes veitchii", in contrast, is one of the most conspicuously hairy of all "Nepenthes" species, with all parts bearing an indumentum of mostly simple (unbranched), patent (unobstructed), copper-coloured hairs 3–4 mm long.
Given the small number of specimens originally observed by Cantley, there has been some speculation that "N. robcantleyi" may represent an F1 natural hybrid.
Martin Cheek considered this possibility in the type description, and while accepting "N. truncata" as a possible parent species, he concluded that no other known Philippine species could account for the combination of characters seen in "N. robcantleyi". "Nepenthes veitchii", a Borneo endemic, was discounted as a possible parent since "N. robcantleyi" shows no evidence of the conspicuous indumentum of that species, not even in a reduced state.
Moreover, "N. robcantleyi" exhibits a number of characters not seen in either "N. truncata" or "N. veitchii", namely a basally domed lid, its associated concentration of nectar glands, and bracts on the partial peduncles.
Cheek speculated that "N. robcantleyi" might have evolved from a plant similar to "N. veitchii" that had spread to Mindanao by long-distance dispersal from Borneo and there acquired its present suite of characters.
No natural hybrids involving "N. robcantleyi" have been recorded with certainty.
However, one of the original batch of 11 seed-grown plants (one of the four that were sent to Tony Paroubek in the US) produced pitchers roughly intermediate in appearance between those of "N. robcantleyi" and "N. truncata".
Since these species were sympatric at the site where the seeds were collected, it has been suggested that this cultivated specimen may have represented a natural cross between them.
This plant, which Paroubek called "clone C", was prone to producing deformed and slightly variegated leaves and eventually died.

The Albanians of Croatia are people of full or partial Albanian ancestry and heritage in Croatia.
They are an autochthonous national minority recognized by the Constitution of Croatia.
As such, they elect a special representative to the Croatian Parliament, shared with members of four other national minorities.
In the 2011 Croatian census, there were 17,513 Albanians living in Croatia, 0.41% of total population.
The largest religious groups among the Albanians were Muslims (9,594 or 54.8% of them) and Catholics (7,109 or 40.6% of them).
In the 1712/14 census done in Lika and Krbava among Vlach population, and other documents, many surnames with Albanian and Arbanasi word roots were recorded, such as those with suffixes "-aj" (e.g.
Bulaja, Mataija, Šolaja, Saraja, Suknajić, Rapajić), "-ez" (Kokez, Kekez, Ivez, Malez etc. ), and others (Šimleša, Šimrak, Šinđo/a/n, Šintić, Kalember, Flego, Macura, Cecić, Kekić, Zotović etc.).
Albanians came to Croatia in various historical periods.
In the Middle Ages they lived in coastal cities and some were assimilated with Vlachs, in the 17th and 18th century the Arbanasi people settled the area around Zadar, and in modern time they came as seasonal workers, war refugees or sportspeople.
Many people in Croatia descended from earlier waves of Albanian migration bear surnames of linguistically Albanian origin, but do not speak the language and are not considered to be Albanians.
The 2011 census shows that at that time 17,513 Albanians lived in Croatia.
This corresponds to 0.41% of the population.
In 2001, the proportion of 15,082 persons had only 0.34%.
Of these, 9,594 (54.8%) are Muslims and 7,109 (40.6%) are Catholics. 17 belong to other Christian denominations and the remaining 793 (4.5%) are partly atheists, partly agnostics, give no indication with respect to religion or belong to other religions.
Albanians are concentrated in Istria (2,393), Dalmatia (1,025), Zadar (908) and in the north of the Croatian coast (2,410) as well as in the capital Zagreb (4,292).
More live in smaller numbers scattered throughout Croatia.
In the Middle Ages there was a large Albanian community in Ragusa (today's Dubrovnik).
In a document dating from 1285 from there, the sentence Audivi unam vocem clamantem in monte in lingua albanesca ("I heard a calling voice from the mountains in [[Albanian language") is handed down.
This is the oldest written record of the [[Albanian language]] per se.
Some of them came to Croatian lands at the time of Venetian rule because in parts of [[Croatia]] and [[Albania]] were under the rule of the Venetian Republic.
Thus through the internal migration, the Albanian families also migrated, of which a large number was croatianized over the centuries to come.
Internal migration has been of economic nature.
Another period is the time of liberation wars against the [[Ottomans]] when Christian [[Albanians|Albanian]] families migrated to the liberated territories of [[Croatia]].
The [[Arbanasi people|Arbanasi]] (Albanian also Arbëreshët e Zarës "Albanians of Zadar") are a small population group in [[Croatia]] still existing today.
They are ethnically Catholic [[Albanians]] who fled the [[Ottomans]] between 1726 and 1733 in the Croatian coastal country, where they are still present today.
In the city of [[Zadar]] they founded their own named after them district, which persists to this day.
The Arbanasi traditionally speak a different dialect of Albanian.
The original Albanian inhabitants of Catholic faith Peroj (Albanian Përrua) in [[Pula]], who fled from the [[Ottomans]] in 1657, have given up their Albanian nationality.
At the time of [[Yugoslavia]], [[Albanians]] migrated to [[Croatia]] for economic and political reasons, especially after 1945. [[Albanians|Albanian]] migrants were mainly from [[Kosovo]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]].
Traditionally, Croatian [[Albanians]] have been involved with jewelery, filigree, bakery and restaurant management, such as bakeries and confectioners.
According to the Association of Volunteers of the Homeland War, 2,579 Albanian volunteers fought in the [[Croatian Army]] and various Croat paramilitary units during the [[Croatian War for Independence]], with losses of 86 killed, 37 missing and more than 500 injured.
Among the Albanians who fought during the war were the generals [[Rahim Ademi]] and [[Agim Çeku]]. [[File:Vestibule of Cathedral of St. Lawrence in Trogir.jpg|thumb|right|The relief of the entrance of the [[Trogir Cathedral|Cathedral]] of [[Trogir]] worked by [[Andrea Nikollë Aleksi]].]]

Autenti (Latin: Rite Autentensis) was a Roman–Berber civitas and bishopric in Africa Proconsularis.
It was a diocese of the Roman Catholic Church.
Autenti was a civitas of the Roman province of Byzacena, the ruins of which are situated between Sbeitla and Thyna in modern Tunisia.
The town was the seat of an ancient episcopal see.
There are two known bishops of Autenti.
Both these bishops are from late antiquity with no references to the diocese during the great councils of the 4th century indicating that the bishopric may have been of late establishment.
Today Autenti survives as titular bishopric and the current bishop is Gilberto Alfredo Vizcarra Mori, of Peru.
Sir Thomas Downing "T. D." Kendrick, KCB (1 April 1895 – 2 November 1979) was a British archaeologist and art historian.
Kendrick was born in Handsworth, a suburb of Birmingham, England, and educated at Charterhouse School and Oriel College, Oxford, for a year before World War I, during which he was wounded and rose to the rank of captain.
Initially specializing in prehistoric art, Kendrick turned in the 1930s to Viking and Anglo-Saxon art, for which his two survey volumes were long standard references.
Kendrick was Director of the British Museum from 1950 until he retired in 1959.
He believed in cleaning museum objects, but this resulted in numerous bronze artifacts in his department being overcleaned.
He was a keen advocate of Victorian art, with assistance from the poet John Betjeman and the painter John Piper, amongst others.
Kendrick's notes on Victorian stained glass were used by Nikolaus Pevsner for his Buildings of England series (Pevsner Architectural Guides).
Kendrick died in Dorchester, Dorset.
Kladzany is a village and municipality in Vranov nad Topľou District in the Prešov Region of eastern Slovakia.

The municipality lies at an altitude of 130 metres and covers an area of 5.357 km².
It has a population of about 557 people.
The records for genealogical research are available at the state archive "Statny Archiv in Presov, Slovakia"
Hot Water Extraction (HWE) is a method of carpet cleaning.
It involves a combination of hot water and cleaning agents being injected into the fibers of a carpet at high pressure and all lifted soil being removed by a powerful vacuum.
Though commonly called "steam cleaning", no actual steam is involved in the HWE cleaning process apart from steam that may escape incidentally from hot water.
When the cleaning solution comes in contact with the carpet, it is 50 to 120 degrees Celsius, depending on the heat available from the cleaning unit.
In a modern truck-mounted carpet cleaning machine, water can be heated under pressure to over 150 degrees Celsius, but after passing through high-pressure steel braided hose and several manifolds, the water loses much of its heat.
HWE begins with preconditioning using a pre-spray cleaner with a typical alkalinity of 7 pH or above being applied to the soiled surface, followed by light agitation with a grooming or pile brush.
For heavily soiled areas a Counter-Rotating Brush (CRB) can be used after the appropriate dwell time.
Next, the surface is passed over several times with a cleaning wand or rotary extractor to thoroughly rinse out the preconditioner, using an acidic solution to reduce the pH of the carpet fibers back to a neutral state.
In the next stage, the carpet is dried using a fan or carpet dryer.
The final stage is resetting the carpet pile to remove any unsightly wand lines, commonly referred to as "shark teeth", with a carpet groom or brush.
Professional machines range from portable machines, which use electricity to heat the water and power the water pump and vacuum motors, to larger truck-mounted machines.
Truck-mounted machines are normally either powered by a stationary engine or PTO powered machines installed in a van or truck.
Portable machines are able to access difficult to reach buildings and higher floors, while truck-mounted machines are more powerful and can clean and dry faster.
Consumer-grade rental machines use similar technology to professional systems, but with less power and usually without an element to heat water.
These units are not typically labeled as HWE systems.
The Shambles is an American power pop and rock group from San Diego, California.
Formed in 1990 from members of other regional bands, The Shambles have released numerous CDs, LPs and 7-inch singles, have toured extensively in the United States, and performed in the UK (including an appearance at the Marquee Club in London), Mexico and Spain.
The founding members of The Shambles were guitarist Kevin Donaker-Ring (formerly of Manual Scan), Brad Wilkins formerly of Manual Scan (who came up with the name of the band), Ray Brandes and David Klowden (both formerly of The Tell-Tale Hearts), and bassist Mark Zadarnowski (formerly of The Crawdaddys).
Guitarist/singer Bart Mendoza (also from Manual Scan) joined the group a few months later, and when Brandes departed soon after their 1991 U.K. tour, another former Tell Tale Heart, keyboardist Bill Calhoun also joined the group.
Klowden departed shortly thereafter followed a year later by Calhoun.
Zadarnowski parted ways with the band in 2005, leaving the core of Donaker-Ring and Mendoza.
Following a brief stint from bassist David Lizerbram (formerly of Kite Flying Society), Florida native Kenny Howes (who has performed with Pat DiNizio and is fill in bassist with The Smithereens) joined the group in 2005, alternating between bass guitar and 12-string Rickenbacker, playing his last show with the band on May 1, 2010, before relocating to Dallas, Texas.
Since Klowden's departure the groups drum duties have been filled by numerous drummers, including Mike Kamoo (The Stereotypes), Victor Penalosa (The Flamin' Groovies), Joel Valder (Sparkle*Jets U.K.), Todd Woolsey (Static Halo), John Chilson (The Loons) and Ron Silva (The Crawdaddys).
The changeover in drummers is something of a running joke amongst the band, who issue an "I Was a Shambles drummer" pin to players.
In 2015 the band released a 7-inch 4-track vinyl EP, Radio Daze, on Bickerton Records in Spain, composed of live radio sessions recorded for DJ Tim Pyles and the 91X program, Loudspeaker.
In 2016, Spanish television network RTVE included footage of the Shambles in a music documentary series, Cachitos de Hierro y Cromo - in an episode called, YEAH, YEAH!

A Shalom Zachar (also: "Sholom Zochor", "Shulem Zucher", ; trans. "Welcoming the male"; lit.
"Peace be upon the male"), is a gathering which takes place in Ashkenazi Jewish circles on the first Friday night after a baby boy is born.
Although intended to "console" the newborn, the get-together is treated as a happy occasion.
The source for this practice is the ruling of the Rema in the Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 265:12: It is customary to make a festive meal on the Friday night after the birth of a baby boy.
People go to the house where the baby is, to taste something [there], and this [eating] is also [considered] a seudat mitzvah.
The Taz, a major commentator on the Rema, finds the source for the Rema's statement in the Talmudic tractate of Niddah (30b).
Here the Talmud states that while a baby develops within the womb, "he is taught the entire Torah.
However, as soon as he enters the air of this world, an angel comes and strikes him on his mouth, causing him to forget the entire Torah" (Taz, Yoreh Deah 265:13).
Because the baby forgot all the Torah he learned, he is likened to a mourner.
Just as people visit a mourner in his home to comfort him during the mourning period, people visit the home of the newborn to console him for the Torah he has forgotten.
Rabbi Yaakov Emden writes that this meal is called a "Seudat Zachar" (Meal of Remembrance), and is held specifically on Shabbat because that day is also connected with remembrance, as the Torah states, "Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it" (Exodus 20:8).
The "Terumat HaDeshen" and "Kitzur Shulchan Aruch Chapter 163:8" consider the Shalom Zachar a Seudat mitzvah.
In current practice, the Shalom Zachar is an informal, drop-in gathering which takes place after the Friday night meal.
The location of the gathering is determined by where the father of the new baby spends Shabbat, since he presides over the event.
Thus, a Shalom Zachar usually takes place in the home of the newborn (even if the newborn is still in the hospital), although it may also take place at the home of grandparents, in-laws, or even friends with whom the father is spending Shabbat.
Typically, mainly men and boys drop by to convey their congratulations, to have a bite to eat, to share words of Torah, and to sing songs welcoming the newborn and thanking God for the birth.
If the mother is already back home with the baby, female relatives or friends will usually drop by to visit her as well.
Typical light refreshments include cake, cookies, popcorn, pretzels, nuts and seeds, soft drinks, and beer.
In addition, chickpeas are customarily served because they are a round-shaped food eaten by mourners (as they symbolize the cyclical nature of life).
Beer is served as it is cheap and most can afford to buy it.
A Shalom Zachar is not held when this Friday night coincides with the night of Yom Kippur or the night of the Passover Seder.
Yom Kippur is a fast day, and therefore all eating and drinking is forbidden.
On the night of the Passover Seder, it is forbidden to eat anything after eating the afikomen, which is eaten at the end of the meal.
If the Shalom Zachar falls on a Friday night during any other day of Passover, matzah cakes and potato-flour cookies will be served instead of regular flour cakes and cookies.
Sephardic Jews do not hold a Shalom Zachar.
Instead, their custom is to conduct a gathering called a Brit Yitzchak on the evening preceding the newborn boy's brit milah.

Hrafnsmál (Old Norse "raven song") is a fragmentary skaldic poem generally accepted as being written by the 9th-century Norwegian skald Þorbjörn Hornklofi. "Hrafnsmál" largely consists of a conversation between an unnamed valkyrie and a raven; the two discuss the life and martial deeds of Harald Fairhair.
Due to this, the poem is sometimes referred to as Haraldskvæði.
The meter of the poem is dominantly "Málaháttr", while smaller portions are in Ljóðaháttr and Fornyrðislag.

He attended Choate Rosemary Hall (Wallingford, CT) for high school, and graduated with honors from Williams College (Williamstown, MA) in 1993, with a dual degree in Political Science and History.
Young’s father was British entrepreneur Paul Young, who owned the New York City boutique Paraphernalia in the 1960s and was credited with bringing mod fashion, including the mini skirt trend, from London to America.
His father died in 2003.
He has one sister and currently resides in Los Angeles.

Atlantic chub mackerel ("Scomber colias") is a pelagic schooling species of mackerel found in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Black Sea.
It was originally thought to be a subspecies of the chub mackerel "Scomber japonicus colias".
The Atlantic chub mackerel is a long, streamlined fish with a deeply forked tail, is all covered with very small fish scale.
The first dorsal fin has 9 or 10 spines and is separated from the second dorsal fin by a space at least as long as its base.
The origin of the anal fin is directly below or just behind the origin of the second dorsal fin.
This fish is silvery in colour, the upper surface has oblique zigzagging lines while the belly is paler and spotted or marked with wavy lines.
This fish is particularly abundant in the eastern Mediterranean.
Two variants are distinguished: in the late summer and autumn, the fish is fat and roe-filled, whereas in the late winter and spring it is very lean, almost emaciated.
The Greek names for the two forms are "koliós" and "tsíros", respectively.
They are usually roasted, although the former form is often packed in salt for later consumption.
The fish releases its own oil into the salt packing and acquires a very long shelf life.
In the islands of the Aegean, it is a particularly popular delicacy, under the name "goúna": fresh-caught mackerel is split open at the belly, eviscerated, and left to dry flesh-side up in the sun for one day.
The same evening it is very briefly seared over a fire and then served with lemon juice.
This fish has a wide range and is abundant over parts of that range.
Although it is heavily fished in places, the population seems relatively stable and the IUCN has listed this species as Least Concern.
Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine (10 January 1750 – 17 November 1823) was a British lawyer and politician.
He served as Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom between 1806 and 1807 in the Ministry of All the Talents.
Erskine was the third and youngest surviving son of Henry Erskine, 10th Earl of Buchan, and was born in a tenement at the head of South Grays Close on the High Street in Edinburgh.
His older brothers were David (Lord Cardross and later the 11th Earl of Buchan) and Henry (later Lord Advocate of Scotland).
His mother, Agnes Steuart, was the daughter of a solicitor general for Scotland and undertook much of her children's education as the family, though noble, were not rich.
The family moved to St Andrews, where they could live more cheaply, and Erskine attended the grammar school there.
The family's money having been spent on the education of his older brothers, Erskine, aged fourteen, reluctantly abandoned his formal education for the time being and went to sea as a midshipman.
His family meanwhile moved to Bath to become members of the Methodist community headed by Selina, Countess of Huntingdon.
One of Erskine's sisters, Anne Agnes, was to become treasurer of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon's charities.
Erskine went to sea as a midshipman in the "Tartar", under captain Sir David Lindsay, who was a nephew of Lord Mansfield and a friend of the Erskine family.
The "Tartar" set sail for the Caribbean, where Erskine was to spend the next four years, rising to the rank of acting lieutenant.
When Erskine was eighteen he resigned from the Navy.
His ship had been paid off, there were no commissions available, and he didn't want to return to sea as a midshipman after having been an acting lieutenant.
The 10th Earl of Buchan had recently died, and Erskine now had just enough money to buy a commission in the army, becoming an ensign in the 1st (Royal) Regiment of Foot.
He was stationed first at Berwick and then on Jersey.
On 29 March 1770 Erskine married Frances Moore at Gretna Green, against the wishes of her father, Daniel Moore who was member of parliament for Great Marlowe.
Frances was the granddaughter of John Moore, who had been attorney general of Pennsylvania.
Erskine's regiment was then posted to Minorca, and Frances went with him.
Before meeting Frances, Erskine had written about the qualities he was looking for in a bride: "Let then my ornament be far from the tinsel glare, let it be fair yet modest, let it rather delight than dazzle, rather shine like the mild beams of the morning than the blaze of the noon.
I seek in my fair one a winning female softness both in person and mind".
Erskine appears to have found these qualities in Frances: she is described on her memorial in Hampstead Church as "the most faithful and affectionate of women".
The couple had four sons and four daughters.
While he was stationed in Jersey and Minorca, Erskine had on occasion preached sermons to his men, prompting one biographer to say that "a taste for oratory that ultimately would lead on to his true career originated in those soldier sermons".
He also demonstrated his future skills as an advocate in a pamphlet entitled ""Observations on the Prevailing Abuses in the British Army Arising from the Corruption of Civil Government with a Proposal toward Obtaining an Addition to Their Pay"".
Whilst on leave in London in 1772, the charming and well-connected young officer was able to mix in literary circles and met Dr Johnson.
James Boswell, in his "Life of Johnson", recalled meeting "a young officer in the regimentals of the Scots royal, who talked with a vivacity, fluency and precision so uncommon, that he attracted particular attention.
He proved to be the Honorable Thomas Erskine, youngest brother to the Earl of Buchan, who has since risen into such brilliant reputation at the Bar in Westminster-hall".
Although Erskine was appointed a lieutenant in April 1773, he decided to leave the army and, with the encouragement of his family and Lord Mansfield, study for the Bar.
Erskine was admitted as a student of Lincoln's Inn on 26 April 1775.
He discovered that the period of study required before being called to the Bar could be reduced from five years to three for holders of a degree from Oxford or Cambridge universities.
He therefore on 13 January 1776 entered himself as a gentleman commoner on the books of Trinity College, Cambridge where, as the son of an earl, he was entitled to gain a degree without sitting any examinations.
He did however win the English declamation prize for an oration on the "glorious revolution" of 1688.
At the same time, he was a pupil in the chambers of first Francis Buller and then George Wood.
These were years of poverty for Erskine and his growing family: he installed Frances and the children in cheap lodgings in Kentish Town and survived on a gift of £300 from a relative, and the sale of his army commission.
Jeremy Bentham, who knew Erskine at this time, described him as "so shabbily dressed as to be quite remarkable".
In the summer of 1778 Erskine was awarded a degree and was called to the Bar on 3 July.
While many newly qualified barristers, especially those without contacts to put briefs their way, took years to establish themselves, Erskine's success was immediate and brilliant.
His first case, that of Thomas Baillie, came to him by chance.
The case involved the Greenwich Hospital for Seamen, of which Captain Baillie was lieutenant-governor.
Baillie had uncovered abuses in the management of the hospital and, having failed to interest the directors and governors of the hospital or the lords of the Admiralty, he published a pamphlet and was then sued by the agents of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich who was first lord of the Admiralty and had been placing his agents in positions of authority in the hospital.
Hearing of a newly qualified barrister who had himself been a seaman and was sympathetic to his cause, Baillie appointed Erskine to his team although he already had four counsel.
Erskine was the most junior, but it was his brilliant speech that won the case and exonerated Baillie.
Despite a warning from the judge, Erskine attacked Lord Sandwich calling him "the dark mover behind the scene of iniquity".
After his success in the Baillie case, Erskine had no shortage of work and a few months later was retained by Admiral Augustus Keppel in his court martial at Portsmouth.
Keppel was acquitted and gave Erskine £1,000 in gratitude.
For the first time in his life Erskine was financially secure.
In 1781 Erskine had his first opportunity to address a jury when he defended Lord George Gordon who had been charged with high treason for instigating the anti-Catholic riots of 1780.
Erskine's defence not only achieved Gordon's acquittal but also dealt a blow to the English legal doctrine of constructive treason.
The case established Erskine as the country's most successful barrister.
By 1783, when he received a patent of precedence, he had earnt enough to pay off all his debts and accumulate £8–9,000.
He could afford a country house, Evergreen Villa, in Hampstead as well as a house in Lincoln's Inn Fields.
In 1783, when the Fox-North Coalition came into power, Erskine entered parliament as Whig member for Portsmouth.
Erskine's friend Charles James Fox had been eager to have such a brilliant lawyer join the ranks of Whig members, but Erskine's speeches failed to make the impact in parliament that they did in court.
Erskine lost his seat the following year in the general election, becoming one of "Fox's martyrs" when Pitt's party made large gains, although he would regain the seat in 1790.
The loss of his parliamentary seat enabled Erskine to concentrate on his legal practice.
In 1786, when he was thirty-six years old and had been practising at the Bar for only eight years, he was able to write: "I continue highly successful in my profession, being now, I may say, as high as I can go at the Bar.
The rest depends on politics, which at present are adverse."
Amongst his notable cases in 1780s was his successful defence of William Davies Shipley, dean of St Asaph (and son of Jonathan Shipley) who was tried in 1784 at Shrewsbury for seditious libel for publishing "Principles of Government, in a Dialogue between a Gentleman and a Farmer", a tract by his brother-in-law Sir William Jones advancing radical views on the relationship between subjects and the state.
Erskine's defence anticipated the Libel Act 1792, which laid down the principle that it is for the jury (who previously had only decided the question of publication) and not the judge to decide whether or not a publication is a libel.
In 1789 he was counsel for John Stockdale, a bookseller, who was charged with seditious libel in publishing John Logan's pamphlet in support of Warren Hastings, whose impeachment was then proceeding.
Erskine's speech, which resulted in the Stockdale's acquittal, argued that a defendant should not be convicted if his composition, taken as a whole, did not go beyond a free and fair discussion, even if selected passages might be libellous.
Henry Brougham considered this to be one of Erskine's finest speeches: "It is justly regarded, by all English lawyers, as a consummate specimen of the art of addressing a jury".
Three years later he would, against the advice of his friends, take on the defence of Thomas Paine who had been charged with seditious libel after the publication of the second part of his "Rights of Man".
Paine was tried in his absence; he was in France.
Erskine argued for the right of a people to criticise, reform and change its government; he made the point that a free press produces security in the government.
But in this case his arguments failed to convince the special jury, who returned a verdict of guilty without even retiring.
Erskine's speech is also remembered for a passage on the duty of barristers to take on even unpopular cases: "I will for ever, at all hazards, assert the dignity, independence, and integrity of the English Bar, without which impartial justice, the most valuable part of the English constitution, can have no existence.
From the moment that any advocate can be permitted to say that he "will" or will "not" stand between the Crown and the subject arraigned in the court where he daily sits to practise, from that moment the liberties of England are at an end."
Erskine's decision to defend Paine cost him his position as attorney-general (legal advisor) to the Prince of Wales, to which he had been appointed in 1786.
In 1794 William Pitt's government, fearful of a revolution, decided to take action against people who were campaigning for parliamentary reform.
Habeas corpus was suspended and twelve members of radical societies were imprisoned and charged with a variety of offences amounting to high treason.
Erskine and Vicary Gibbs were assigned as counsel to seven of them.
They were not paid for their services, as it was considered unprofessional to take fees for defending people charged with high treason.
The treason trials began on 28 October before Lord Chief Justice Eyre at the Old Bailey with the trial of Thomas Hardy, a shoemaker and secretary of the London Corresponding Society.
After eight days of evidence and speeches, including Erskine's seven-hour speech on the final day, and several hours deliberation, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.
Erskine was hailed as a hero by the crowds outside who unharnessed his horses (which he never saw again) and pulled his carriage through the streets.
Although it was usual in cases where several people were jointly charged with high treason to discharge the rest if the first was acquitted, the government persisted with the trials of John Horne Tooke and John Thelwall.
They too, defended by Erskine and Vicary Gibbs, were acquitted and it was only then that the prosecution was halted.
A disappointed government had to scrap a further 800 warrants of arrest.
Notable amongst the later cases of Erskine's career was that of James Hadfield, a former soldier who had fired a shot at the king in Drury Lane Theatre.
The shot missed and Hadfield was charged with treason.
Erskine called a large number of witnesses who testified to Hadfield's sometimes bizarre behaviour, a surgeon who testified to the nature of the head injuries that Hadfield had sustained in battle, and a doctor, Alexander Crichton, who gave evidence that Hadfield was insane.
Erskine argued that, although Hadfield could appear rational, he was in the grip of a delusion and could not control his actions.
He summed up: "I must convince you, not only that the unhappy prisoner was a lunatic, within my own definition of lunacy, but that the act in question was the immediate unqualified offspring of the disease".
The judge, Lord Kenyon, was convinced by Erskine's evidence and argument and stopped the trial, acquitted Hadfield and ordered him to be detained.
The trial led to two acts of parliament: the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 which provided for the detention of people who were acquitted of a crime by reason of insanity, and the Treason Act 1800.
In 1806 Erskine was offered the Lord Chancellorship in the Ministry of All the Talents formed by Lord Grenville and Charles Fox on the death of William Pitt.
Fox's original plan had been to offer Erskine the chief judgeship of the Common Pleas or the King's Bench when one of the holders was elevated to Lord Chancellor.
But both Lord Ellenborough, chief justice of the King's Bench and Sir James Mansfield, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, declined the chancellorship.
Erskine was therefore appointed although he had no experience in Chancery.
He was created a peer to become Lord Chancellor.
The Prince of Wales, who had inherited the Duchy of Cornwall, chose Erskine's title, Baron Erskine of Restormel Castle, while the motto, "trial by jury" was Erskine's own.
Frances Erskine did not live to enjoy the title of Lady Erskine; she died a few weeks before her husband took the seals of office.
Although Erskine lacked experience in equity, only one of the judgements he made during his brief tenure as Lord Chancellor was appealed against and that, concerning Peter Thellusson's will, was upheld.
His handling of the impeachment of Lord Melville was generally admired.
Along with Lords Grenville, Spencer and Ellenborough, Erskine was commissioned by the king to enquire into the morals of his daughter-in-law Caroline of Brunswick in what became known as the "delicate investigation".
Erskine was Lord Chancellor for only fourteen months, having to give up the seals of office when the ministry of all the talents resigned over a disagreement with the king concerning the question of Catholic Emancipation.
The king gave Erskine a week to finish pending cases, and Erskine took advantage of this to appoint one of his sons-in-law, Edward Morris, as master of Chancery.
As ex-chancellor, Erskine was not permitted to return to the Bar.
He was awarded a pension of £4000 a year and remained a member of the House of Lords.
He was only 57 when the ministry of all the talents fell, and hoped that he might return to office when the Prince of Wales became regent.
In the event, however, the regent retained the ministry of Spencer Perceval and the Whigs would not be in power again until 1830, seven years after Erskine's death.
Erskine largely retired from public life, rarely speaking in the House of Lords.
In 1818 he married for the second time.
His bride was a former apprentice bonnet-maker, Sarah Buck, with whom he had already had two children.
The couple travelled to Gretna Green for the marriage, with an angry adult son in hot pursuit.
It was a tempestuous relationship, and the marriage ended in separation a few years later.
In spite of his generous pension and the enormous sums he had earnt at the Bar, Erskine experienced financial difficulties in his later years, having to sell his villa in Hampstead and move to a house in Pimlico.
He also bought an estate in Sussex, but his agricultural efforts were not a great success.
He wrote a political romance, "Armata", which ran to several editions.
Causes which Erskine took up in his retirement were animal rights, Greek independence, and the defence of Queen Caroline.
He had always been an animal lover; amongst his favourite animals were a Newfoundland dog called Toss who used to accompany him to chambers, a macaw, a goose and two leeches.
He introduced a bill in the House of Lords for the prevention of cruelty to animals, arguing that humanity's dominion over them was given by God as a moral trust.
It was the first time he had proposed a change in the law.
The bill was accepted in the Lords but opposed in the Commons; William Windham arguing that a law against cruelty to animals was incompatible with fox-hunting and horse racing.
Eventually the bill was introduced in the Commons and passed as statute 3 Geo 4 c71.
When Caroline was being prosecuted for divorce Erskine spoke against the Bill of Pains and Penalties and, when the government dropped the bill, expressed his approval: "My Lords, I am an old man, and my life, whether it has been for good or evil, has been passed under the sacred rule of Law.
In this moment I feel my strength renovated by that rule being restored".
He was invited to a public dinner in Edinburgh in February 1820, and made his first trip to Scotland since he had left it on the "Tartar" over fifty years before.
In 1823 Erskine set out by sea on another visit to Scotland with one of his sons, hoping to see his brother the Earl of Buchan.
But he became ill with a chest infection on the journey and was put ashore at Scarborough.
He managed to travel to the home of his brother Henry's widow in Almondell in West Lothian, where they were joined by the earl.
He died at Almondell on 17 November 1823 and was buried in the family burial-place at Uphall in Linlithgowshire.
His widow survived him by over thirty years.
She, as reports in the Times revealed, was reduced to poverty and had to rely on a small charitable allowance to survive.
Even these meagre payments were withheld by Erskine's executors when she tried to prevent them sending her son Hampden away to school, and she had to appeal to the lord mayor of London.
She died in 1856.
Erskine's first marriage produced four sons and four daughters.
David Montagu Erskine (1776–1855) was a member of parliament and diplomat; Henry David (1786–1859) was Dean of Ripon; Thomas (1788–1864) became a judge of the Court of Common Pleas; Esmé Steuart (1789–1817) fought at the Battle of Waterloo where he lost an arm (his widow Eliza married Admiral James Norton, who also lost an arm in action).
Frances (d. 1859) married Samuel Holland, Precentor of Chichester and Rector of Poynings, Sussex (a grandson of Frances and Samuel was Thomas Erskine Holland the jurist); Elizabeth (d, 1800) married her cousin Captain (later Sir) David Erskine, the illegitimate son of the 11th Earl of Buchan; Mary (d. 1804) married lawyer Edward Morris.
With his second wife Erskine had one legitimate son, Hampden (b. 1821) and two children, Agnes and Erskine, born before the marriage.
Erskine's eldest brother the 11th Earl of Buchan had no legitimate sons and was succeeded by a nephew, the son of Erskine's brother Henry.
When all Henry's descendants in the direct male line died out in 1960 the seventh Baron Erskine (Donald Cardross Flower Erskine, Erskine's great-great-greatgrandson) became the sixteenth Earl of Buchan.
Adolph William "Al" Schwimmer (;‎ 10 June 1917 – 10 June 2011) was an American and later Israeli engineer and businessman.
He was the founder and first CEO of Israel Aerospace Industries.
Schwimmer was born in New York City in 1917 to Jewish parents who had emigrated to the United States from Eastern Europe.
He never used his given birth name of Adolph, preferring the nickname "Al".
In 1939, Schwimmer began his aerospace career at Lockheed Corporation as an engineer and also received his civilian pilot license.
During World War II, he worked for TWA and assisted the U.S. Air Transport Command as a flight engineer.
During Israel's War of Independence, Schwimmer used his World War II experience and his contacts to smuggle surplus war planes to Israel as that fledgling state battled against the invading armies of its neighbors.
Schwimmer reflected on what motivated these actions in an interview with Boaz Dvir.
The alternative was described as a "Second Holocaust [...] they believed that those 600,000 Jews were going to die."
Using circuitous routes, he also recruited the pilots and crews to fly the planes to Israel.
Many of these men became the nucleus of the Israeli Air Force.
In 1949, Schwimmer returned to the United States and, in 1950, he was convicted in the United States of violating the US Neutrality Acts for smuggling the planes into Israel.
Schwimmer was stripped of his voting rights and veteran benefits and fined $10,000, but did not receive a prison sentence.
Schwimmer refused to ask for a pardon, believing that smuggling weapons to help create a Jewish State was the right moral decision to make, and that breaking the law was a proper form of moral civil disobedience.
In 2001 President Bill Clinton gave Schwimmer a presidential pardon.
In the early 1950s, Schwimmer, who was running an aircraft maintenance company in Burbank, California, was approached by David Ben-Gurion, Israel's then prime minister, who asked Schwimmer to return to Israel and establish an aircraft company for commercial and military purposes.
Schwimmer acceded to Ben Gurion's request and founded Israel Aerospace Industries, of which he became the first CEO.
Schwimmer was one of the founders of Savyon, but later moved to Tel Aviv.
In the mid-1980s, Schwimmer was a special adviser for technology and industry for Israel's then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who became a close friend.
Schwimmer died on his 94th birthday in Ramat Gan.
In 2015, his exploits during Israel's War of Independence were depicted in the PBS documentary "A Wing and a Prayer", written, directed, and produced by Boaz Dvir.
The film contains the only public interview Schwimmer gave in light of these events.
Olivier Gendebien (12 January 1924 – 2 October 1998) was a Belgian racing driver who was called "one of the greatest sportscar racers of all time".
Gendebien entered a Veritas sports car in the 1955 Grand Prix des Frontières at Chimay.
However, following this race he switched his focus, and teamed up with Fraikin to compete in rally racing using a Jaguar sports car.
Together with Pierre Stasse, Gendebien won the sixth running of the Tulip Rally in Zandvoort in April 1954.
Their car was an Alfa Romeo 1900 TI.
The Gendebien and Fraiken partnership gained the nickname "the eternal bridesmaids", owing to their number of second-place finishes, but after two previous attempts they triumphed in the Liège-Rome-Liège Rally, the Coppa d'Oro delle Dolomiti and Rally Stella Alpina in 1955, driving a Mercedes-Benz 300SL.
Gendebien's success in rally competitions brought him to the attention of Enzo Ferrari, who offered him a contract to drive a Ferrari in sports car events and selected Grands Prix.
Much respected as a true gentleman by everyone who knew him, he remained a member of the Ferrari team until he retired from racing.
Enzo Ferrari summed him up as ""a gentleman who never forgets that noblesse oblige and, when he is at the wheel, he translates this code of behaviour into an elegant and discerning forcefulness"."
During his career he competed in only 15 Formula One races as most of the time he was Ferrari's spare driver, filling in only occasionally.
He nonetheless scored points in five races, and was only one place away from a points-scoring finish on a further two occasions.
He made his début at the 1956 Argentine Grand Prix, with the Ferrari team, but it was during a stint driving for the British Racing Partnership's "Yeoman Credit Racing" team in that Gendebien scored his best finishes; he took second in the 1960 French Grand Prix and third in front of a home crowd at the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix.
The second of these was a somewhat bitter-sweet success, as Gendebien's team-mate at the time, Chris Bristow, was killed in an accident during the race.
Gendebien himself walked away with slight injuries in October 1961 after his Lotus-Climax failed to negotiate a turn during practice for the 1961 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, New York.
The car flipped over and Gendebien's shoes were torn off by the impact.
However, it was in sports car racing, particularly the long distance and endurance events, where Gendebien excelled.
Piloting a 2.5-litre Ferrari, Gendebien teamed up with Maurice Trintignant to place third in the 1956 24 Hours of Le Mans.
They were seven laps behind the winners, privateer Ecurie Ecosse Jaguar drivers Ron Flockhart and Ninian Sanderson.
The 1958 Grand Prix of Buenos Aires was a 1,000 kilometre event in which Gendebien paired with Wolfgang von Trips.
They finished second to a fellow Ferrari pairing Phil Hill and Peter Collins.
In the race Argentine Maserati driver, Jorge Magnasco, died after his car skidded and turned over.
The same year he partnered Hill and won the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans.
Their victory came in a 3-litre Ferrari and secured the World Sportscar Championship for the Ferrari factory.
They covered 2,511 miles with an average speed of 107 miles per hour.
Hill became the first American to win the event and their Ferrari was the sole factory-sponsored car running at the end.
Ferrari drivers took the first three positions at the conclusion of the 1961 24 Hours of Le Mans and, as they were to be again the following year, Hill and Gendebien were first, averaging 115.89 miles per hour, and establishing a race record.
The duo were a natural fit and together they won the Le Mans race three times in total, with Gendebien winning it a fourth time, partnered by fellow Belgian Paul Frère in .
Gendebien's record number of Le Mans victories was not exceeded until , when fellow-Belgian Jacky Ickx won for the fifth time.
Away from Circuit de la Sarthe, Gendebien also triumphed in the Targa Florio (1958, '61, '62), the 12 Hours of Sebring (1959, '60, '61), the 12 Hours of Reims (1957, '58) and the 1000 km Nürburgring (1962).
When asked about the key to winning as a race car driver, Gendebien responded: ""It is a matter of taking the corners a little faster than one would want.""
In honour of Gendebien's three wins at the 12 Hours of Sebring, the turn onto the Ullman straight is named after him.
He also won the Dolomites Cup, a one-lap sportscar race that took place on a 188-mile circuit in the Dolomite Mountains in Italy.
Married with three children, Gendebien’s wife pressured him to get out of the dangerous sport of automobile racing where more than two dozen of his competitors had died at the wheel.
At 38 years of age, in 1962 Olivier Gendebien retired following his fourth victory at Le Mans.
Independently wealthy, and an avid skier, tennis player, and equestrian rider, he devoted the rest of his life to running a variety of businesses.
In 1998 King Albert II awarded him the Belgian Order of the Crown.
Olivier Gendebien died in 1998 at his home in Les Baux-de-Provence in southern France.
The involvement of the Soviet 14th Guards Army in the War of Transnistria was extensive and contributed to the outcome, which left the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR) with "de facto" independence from the Republic of Moldova.
The 14th Army was formed as a unit of the Soviet Army on 25 November 1956 from the 10th Guards Budapest Rifle Corps, formerly part of the Odessa Military District with headquarters in Kishinev.
In 1960 the following divisions were assigned to the army: In 1964 the 88th Motor Rifle Division became the 180th Motor Rifle Division, and the 118th MRD became the 48th MRD.
On 3 November 1967 the army was renamed the 14th Guards Combined Arms Army.
In 1968 the 48th MRD took part in the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, and then joined the newly built Central Group of Forces there.
In the 1980s the army headquarters was moved to Tiraspol, within the then Moldavian SSR.
By 1991, the army was made up of four motor rifle divisions and other smaller units.
Only the 59th Guards Motor Rifle Division and some smaller units, including the 1162nd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment were on the left bank of the Dniester in the region of Transnistria.
Other formations, including the 28th Guards and 180th Motor Rifle Divisions, were over the border in Ukraine and became part of the Ukrainian Ground Forces.
According to the Army sources, local Transnistrians made up the great majority of its soldiers, including 51 percent of the officers and 79 percent of the draftees.
In 1990, the 14th Guards Army included the following units.
On November 19, 1990, the 14th Guard Army beside the above-mentioned units additionally included: The army included 229 tanks, 305 various armored vehicles, 328 artillery guns, mortars, and multiple rocket launchers, 43 battle and 31 transportation helicopters of army aviation (another helicopter regiment was located in Raukhivka, Odessa Oblast) While the official policy of the Russian Federation early after the outbreak of the widespread armed conflict in 1992 was one of neutrality, many soldiers and officers of the 14th Army were sympathetic to the PMR cause and had defected to the PMR and actively participated in the fighting as part of its armed forces, the Republican Guards.
Furthermore, a considerable amount of the army’s materiel was taken without resistance or given to the PMR armed forces.
The commanding officer of the Army, General G. I. Yakovlev, was openly supportive of the newly created PMR.
He participated in the founding of the PMR, served in the PMR Supreme Soviet and accepted the position as the first chairman of the PMR Department of Defense on 3 December 1991, causing the Commander-in-Chief of the CIS armed forces, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, to relieve him of his rank and service in the Russian military.
Yakovlev's successor, General Yuriy Netkachev has assumed a more neutral stance in the conflict.
However, his attempts at mediation between Chişinău (capital of Moldova) and Tiraspol (capital of PMR) were largely unsuccessful.
On 23 March 1992, Shaposhnikov signed a decree authorising the transfer of military equipment of 14th Guards Army units stationed on the right bank of the Dniester to the Republic of Moldova.
This military equipment had constituted the majority of the materiel utilized by the Moldovan army in the ensuing War of Transnistria.
A second decree, issued on 1 April by Boris Yeltsin, transferred the personnel of the 14th Guards Army, as well as all left-bank military equipment, including a large weapons stockpile at Cobasna, under Russian jurisdiction.
By June 1992 the situation had escalated to an open military engagement.
With the near disintegration of the Russian army during the heaviest fighting in and around the city of Bendery, in the wake of a coordinated offensive by Moldovan forces, General Major Alexander Lebed arrived at the 14th Army headquarters on 23 June with standing orders to stop the ongoing conflict with any available means, inspect the army, prevent the theft of armaments from its depots and ensure the unimpeded evacuation of armaments and Army personnel from Moldovan and through Ukrainian territory.
After briefly assessing the situation, he assumed command of the army, relieving Netkachev, and ordered his troops to enter the conflict directly.
On 3 July at 03:00, a massive artillery strike originating from the 14th Army formations stationed on left bank of the Dniester obliterated the Moldovan force concentrated in Hîrbovăț forest, near Bendery, effectively ending the military phase of the conflict.
According to at least one Moldovan source, 112 Moldovan soldiers were killed by the bombardment.
After the end of the conflict, a separate Russian unit was moved into the region as part of the joint Russian-Moldovan-Transnistrian peacekeeping force, the Joint Control Commission.
The 14th Guards Army itself was reformed in April 1995 into the Operational Group of Russian Forces in Moldova which came under the command of the Moscow Military District and was charged with guarding the weapons stockpile at Cobasna.
Another more recent source gives the disbandment date of the 14th Guards Army as 25 June 1995.
The 59th Guards Motor Rifle Division became the 8th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade on 1 June 1997.
The force is now around 1200 strong, and according to Kommersant-Vlast in 2005, consisted of the 8th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, the 1162nd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment, 15th Signals Regiment, and other support units.
On 1 November 2002 the 8th MR Brigade was disbanded, and the remaining personnel, numbering 5,719 effectives were absorbed into the Peacekeeping Forces command.
As a result of reduction in the strength of the Operational Group (commander General-Major Boris Sergeyev) the remaining strength as of 2006 is about 1,000 – 1,500 troops, and comprises: The operational group is commanded by Major General Boris Sergeyev of Russia and numbers 1,199 troops.
It serves alongside the Joint Control Commission.
On 18 November 2008, the NATO Parliamentary Assembly adopted a resolution, urging Russia to "respect its commitments which were taken at the Istanbul OSCE Summit in 1999 and withdraw its illegal military presence from the Transnistrian region of Moldova in the nearest future."
On 7 April 2016, Russia announced it would withdraw its troops from Moldova once the problem of liquidating the 14th Army's armament depots was solved.
Complicating the pull out was the necessity to transit the armaments through Ukraine, which the two countries have a negative relationship especially after the War in Donbass.
On 22 June 2018, UN General Assembly adopted resolution (document A/72/L.58), which urged the Russian Federation to unconditionally withdraw its troops and armaments without delay from the territory of the Republic of Moldova.
On 27 June, 2016, a new law entered in force in Transnistria, punishing actions or public statements, including through the usage of mass media, networks of information and telecommunications or internet criticizing the peace-keeping mission of the Russian Army in the Transnistrian Moldovan Republic, or presenting interpretations perceived to be "false" by the Transnistrian government of the Russian Army's peacekeeping mission.
The punishment is up to three years of jail for ordinary people or up to seven years of jail if the crime was committed by a person of responsibility or a group of persons by prior agreement.

A spailpín or spailpeen or "wandering landless labourer" was an itinerant or seasonal farmworker in Ireland from the 17th to the early 20th century.
Conditions for such workers were very harsh.
They endured hard physical labour, low wages and maltreatment by landowners.
According to the "Encyclopedia of Irish History and Culture", "(t)heir numbers were greatest during the difficult years of the 1820s and 1830s.
On the whole, the seasonal workers were people who had close ties to the land: small farmers, cottiers, agricultural laborers, and generally poor people with family responsibilities and no means of earning a living at home.
Women began to participate as workers to an important degree only in the middle of the nineteenth century, in the Scottish potato fields.
Even before this, they provided support for the men by traveling with them; they begged for food and money to keep themselves and their children alive until the men returned home, and they undertook and organized essential farm work back in Ireland, thereby maintaining the small holding of land as the family home".
The difficult life of the landless labourer found ample echo in the arts.
An example in folk tradition of exactly how harsh life for a "spailpín" was can be sensed in the song; ""An Spáilpín Fánach"" a lament of a man who had to become a "spailpín" because of his family’s eviction.
To avoid this terrible life, he joined the French army to fight overseas.
Some "spailpíní" found comfort and catharsis in the arts.
Several were reputed scholars, musicians and poets.
To reflect the misery and hardship in their everyday lives, many of their songs and poems were laments.
For an excellent example of such a lament, see Matt Cranitch, The Irish Fiddle Book, Ossian Pub, page 114 and recording number 47.
The Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada (APEC) was a group in Canada, which campaigned against the Canadian government's policy of official bilingualism.
The group was formed in 1977 by Irene Hilchie, a government employee who felt that she was being discriminated against in her job because she did not speak French.
The group's most famous member, however, was Jock V. Andrew, whose book "Bilingual Today, French Tomorrow" alleged that bilingualism was part of a government plot to make Canada a unilingually French country.
The group was most influential in the late 1980s, as it engaged in activities which contributed to the defeat of the Meech Lake Accord.
As well, the group was involved in a campaign to have Ontario municipalities declare themselves English-only, in response to the Ontario government's "French Language Services Act".
While the act did not apply to municipal government services, APEC represented it as a slippery slope towards such a requirement to convince municipalities to pass English-only resolutions.
Most famously, the city of Sault Ste.
Marie passed such a resolution on January 29, 1990.
Quebec voters perceived the Sault Ste.
Marie resolution and the Brockville flag incident as symbols of English Canada's feelings toward Quebec, and the incidents contributed to the resurgence of the Quebec sovereignty movement in the 1990s and thus to the 1995 Quebec referendum.
APEC also worked closely with the Confederation of Regions Party and the Reform Party, two political parties which held similar views about bilingualism and the role of Quebec in Confederation.
APEC claims to be not anti-French, but believes that tax money was being wastefully used in the promotion of official bilingualism in Canada.
In February 2000, the organization moved its head office to Toronto, and changed its name to Canadians Against Bilingualism Injustice (CABI).
In 2001, the organization changed its name again, becoming the Canadian Network for Language Awareness.
In the 2000 federal election, CABI spent just over $150,000 as a registered third party participant.
Most of the funds were used to place advertisements in Ontario newspapers.
No such participation has been recorded for subsequent elections.
For years, APEC / CABI owned the domain name www.bilingualism.org, but registration lapsed some time between 2000 and 2010.
The Vanuatu kingfisher or chestnut-bellied kingfisher ("Todiramphus farquhari") is a medium-sized kingfisher found only on the islands of Espiritu Santo, Malo and Malakula in Vanuatu.
It is dark blue above with richly coloured orange underparts.
There is a white spot in front of the eye and a broad black band on the side of the head.
It has a white throat and collar.
It measures 19–21 cm in length and weighs 32-42 grams.
The call is a series of loud, shrill, piping notes.
The only other kingfisher in Vanuatu is the Pacific kingfisher which has paler blue-green upperparts, whiter underparts and a buff stripe above the eye.
The Vanuatu kingfisher mainly eats insects, especially beetles, and will also take spiders and small lizards.
It usually hunts by perching on a branch and waiting for prey to appear.
When it spots something it flies into the air or dives down to the ground or a tree trunk to catch it.
The nest is sometimes built in a hole in a palm tree or tree fern but usually a pair will excavate a burrow in a termite mound in a tree.
They dig with their large bill and clear out material with their feet.
After about fifteen days the burrow is completed and the termites seal off their sections.
Three or four white eggs are laid.
The breeding season is mostly from November to February with eggs laid in December.
The birds mainly inhabit dense rainforests in the interior of the islands, particularly above 200m.
They are believed to be declining due to loss and degradation of the forest.
A doorstop (also door stopper, door stop or door wedge) is an object or device used to hold a door open or closed, or to prevent a door from opening too widely.
The same word is used to refer to a thin slat built inside a door frame to prevent a door from swinging through when closed.
A doorstop (applied) may also be a small bracket or 90 degree piece of metal applied to the frame of a door to stop the door from swinging (bi-directional) and converting that door to a single direction (in-swing push or out-swing pull).
A door may be stopped by a doorstop which is simply a heavy solid object, such as a rubber, placed in the path of the door.
These stops are predominantly improvised.
Historically, lead bricks have been popular choices when available.
However, as the toxic nature of lead has been revealed, this use has been strongly discouraged.
Another method is to use a doorstop which is a small wedge of wood, rubber, plastic, cotton or another material.
Manufactured wedges of these materials are commonly available.
The wedge is kicked into position and the downward force of the door, now jammed upwards onto the doorstop, provides enough static friction to keep it motionless.
A third strategy is to equip the door itself with a stopping mechanism.
In this case, a short metal bar capped with rubber, or another high friction material, is attached to a hinge near the bottom of the door opposite the door hinge and on the side of the door which is in the direction that it closes.
When the door is to be kept open, the bar is swung down so that the rubber end touches the floor.
In this configuration, further movement of the door towards being closed increases the force on the rubber end, thereby increasing the frictional force which opposes the movement.
When the door is to be closed, the stop is released by pushing the door slightly more open which releases the stop and allows it to be flipped upwards.
A newer version of equipping the door with the stopping mechanism is to attach a magnet to the bottom of the door on the side which opens outward which then latches onto another magnet or magnetic material on the wall or a small hub on the floor.
The magnet must be strong enough to hold the weight of the door, but weak enough to be easily detached from the wall or hub.
Another type of doorstop is used to prevent doors from opening too far and damaging nearby walls.
In this case a rubber cylinder or dome, or a rod or block of rubber-tipped metal, wood or plastic, is screwed into the wall or the floor in the path of the door.
If it is attached to the wall it may be either a few inches above the ground, or at such a height as to meet the doorknob.
A short wall-attached doorstop, usually a rubber dome or cylinder, is sometimes called a wall bumper.
On occasion, stops are used that are fitted at the midpoint of the door, as part of the central door-hinge.
Such a stop is known as a "hinge stop".
In various British English dialects including those in the south-west, north-east and north-west of England, the word "doorstop" is cognate with "doorstep" in standard English, being derived from "door" + "stoop".

Red Springs is a town in Robeson County in the U.S. state of North Carolina.
The population was 3,428 at the 2010 census.
Red Springs is located in northern Robeson County at (34.814363, -79.184281).

Long before Red Springs was incorporated in 1887 and its postal name changed from its former name of Dora in 1884, one of the first settlers in this community was "Sailor Hector" McNeill.
It is not known exactly how he got his nickname, but he is found using it in the Bladen County tax lists of 1771. (Red Springs is in Robeson County which was formed from Bladen County in 1787.)
"Sailor Hector" McNeill's home was at the top of the hill on the edge of the McNeill cemetery in town, and he and his wife Mary are buried there in unmarked graves.
In the decades before the Civil War up into the early 20th century the community was known as "The Springs", and it became a popular spa and resort in the mid-19th century.
People of that time came from all parts to sample the sweet, iron-rich water and stay at the hotel there, built before 1854 by Malcolm C. McNeill, the grandson of "Sailor Hector".
A letter from a native of the area living in Mississippi dated 1854 mentions that "Red Springs" had a store.
From that time and far beyond its incorporation in 1887, Red Springs grew a great deal.
Between 1896 and 1915, Red Springs had a military school for boys as well as the Southern Conservatory of Music for girls from all over the country.
The military school is long gone, but in time the conservatory became Flora McDonald College, known today as Flora McDonald Academy, a private day school.

Mary Hazelton Blanchard Wade (March 23, 1860 – 1936) was an American writer.
Born Mary Hazelton Blanchard in Charlestown, Massachusetts, daughter of Charles Hentry and Caroline Cecilia Blanchard, she was educated at a high school in Malden then received further education by private tutors.

The Action of 5 September 1782 took place during the American War of Independence between two French Navy frigates, "Aigle" and "Gloire", and a lone British 74-gun ship of the line HMS "Hector".
In a two-day battle, the two frigates severely damaged "Hector" and only failed to captured her when a British squadron appeared on the horizon.
The French withdrew but "Hector" foundered a few days later after the 1782 Central Atlantic hurricane.
The Franco-American alliance in the American War of Independence, resulted in France providing a considerable contribution to the naval operations in the American Revolutionary War.
France and Britain fought to control shipping lanes and supply their side on the American continent, while conducting support operations and landings.
In consequence, both sides often used warships as transports to ferry ammunition and other supplies, troops, funds, and officials; these might only be armed en flûte, depending on their cargo.
In April 1782, a joint Franco-Spanish fleet under Comte de Grasse attempted an invasion of Jamaica.
The fleet met a British fleet under Sir George Rodney, who defeated then in the ensuing Battle of the Saintes.
The British captured a number of ships and in the summer, a convoy under Rear-admiral Graves, on the 74-gun , with the 74-gun ships and , and the 36-gun frigate , escorted the prizes "Ville de Paris", "Glorieux", "Hector" and "Ardent" on the journey back to England.
In early September, "Hector" sailed to Halifax with her prize crew.
In August, two French frigates departed Rochefort to transport funds and officials for Rochambeau's army: they were the 40-gun "Aigle", under Captain de Latouche, and the 32-gun "Gloire", under Captain de Vallongue.
In the night of 4 September 1782, at 135 leagues east of Long Island, "Aigle" and "Gloire" spotted a large ship sailing on a starboard tack under west winds, on a parallel course to theirs.
Closing in, they identified her as a ship of the line; she was in fact "Hector". "Gloire" came under the wind of "Aigle", and "Hector" hailed her.
"Aigle" closed to the wind; instead of imitating this maneuver, "Gloire", fearing to expose her stern to the unknown ship, ran downwind and fired a broadside. "Hector" immediately replied in kind, and the two ships exchanged fire, still without knowing each other's identity.
At the first shot, Latouche ran downwind, but firing had ceased by the time "Aigle" caught up. "Gloire" and "Hector" were discussing their respective nationalities, and firing immediately resumed when they identified each other.
After a while, "Aigle" replaced "Gloire" at "Hector"s beam, as "Aigle" mounted 18-pounder long guns as her main armament, while "Gloire" carried only 12-pounders.
The superiority of "Hector" broadside led Latouche to want to board his opponent rather than continue to engage in an artillery duel, but "Hector" eluded him.
Meanwhile, "Gloire" circled "Hector" and raked her from stem to stern.
The engagement continued until morning light revealed several ships in the distance, at least one of which was unmistakably a ship of the line; Latouche then decided to break off the engagement and resume his mission.
The ships "Aigle" and "Gloire" had spotted were the rest of Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves' convoy.
On 17 September, the 1782 Central Atlantic hurricane caught the British. "Hector" survived, but much damaged in her encounter and in the hurricane, she sank on 4 October; the privateer "Hawke" saved 200 of her crew.
Latouche continued his mission and the French vessels successfully landed their passengers and funds in spite of British opposition.
However, "Aigle" was lost immediately afterwards when she grounded in the Delaware River trying to escape a British squadron; Latouche was taken prisoner.
The British were able to salvage her and take her into service as HMS "Aigle". "Gloire" managed to escape, together with a prize, , that the French had captured on their way into the Delaware.

Soledad is a young, beautiful woman who lives in the small, quiet town of El Guayabo where she works at the local tobacco factory "Caribana" as a winder.
One night, destiny brings her to meet Alejandro, a young and ambitious developer from the city who has lost his memory after being hit on the head and robbed of his possessions.
After a while, the townspeople discover that Alejandro is the owner of the town and the man behind the development project of a beach resort that will destroy their simple way of life, their homes and the tobacco lands surrounding the factory which forms their only source of income.
Everyone begins to treat him with hostility, although he himself is yet to regain his memory.
It is after this discovery that it is revealed that Soledad's real mother who was thought to be dead is actually alive.
Catalina spent the last 20 years in prison for killing her abusive husband who was actually the son of the town's patriarch, Don Luis Santana, owner of the tobacco factory.
Because of this, she is the only legitimate heir and owner of the tobacco lands and thus, she can undo the sale of the lands to the developer.
Don Luis, who is aware of Soledad's true paternity, offers Catalina a deal that if she saves the town from ruin, then he will reunite her with her daughter.
Mother and daughter do not know of each other's existence, as Soledad thinks that the parents that raised her are her real parents while Catalina thinks that her daughter was adopted in another country.
Mother and daughter will finally be reunited, but they will both fall in love with the same man, thus tearing them apart.

Main Attrakionz is an American hip hop duo from Oakland, California, composed of rappers Mondre M.A.N. (Damondre Grice) and Squadda B (Charles Glover).
Grice and Glover met in the seventh grade when they were both kicked out of math class, and began recording raps together.
The two have continued to collaborate and have become known as significant players in the "cloud rap" movement, which features "a splinter sound that's ethereal and often hooked around cascading synth lines and amorphous beats".
On March 2, 2012, Main Attrakionz released "Cloudlife", a collaborative EP with Jel and Zachg.
On October 22, 2012, the duo released their first album, "Bossalinis & Fooliyones", which was noted in "Spin" to have "nine-song run from 'On Tour' to 'Bury Me a Millionaire' is as impressive as anything on a rap record this year".
On their review of the album, "Pitchfork" said of the duo, "here are two guys who clearly love to rap and work hard at it, taking a style they can call their own, and presenting it in a more user-friendly way.
More often than not, they make it work".
On March 11, 2013, the duo collaborated with Montreal-based production duo, Grown Folk and Berlin dubstep artist, Kuedo to release the "Cloud City EP", which "SF Weekly" noted as "probably one of their more out-there collaborations to date".
On June 30, 2015, the duo released "808s & Dark Grapes III", which was produced by Friendzone.
The Croyland or Crowland Chronicle is an important primary source for English medieval history, particularly the late 15th century.
It is named for its place of origin, the Benedictine Abbey of Croyland or Crowland, in Lincolnshire, England.
It was formerly also known as the Chronicle of Ingulf or Ingulphus after its supposed original compiler, the 11th-century abbot Ingulf.
As that section of the text is now known to have been a later forgery, its author is instead known as Pseudo-Ingulf.
Several historical chronicles were written at the Abbey of Croyland, which was the wealthiest religious foundation in eastern England during the Middle Ages.
Alison Weir writes that the chronicles dated before 1117 are "spurious", while the three anonymously written "continuations" that span the periods from 1144-1469, 1459-1468 and 1485-1486 are genuine.
The first entry of the chronicle concerns 655.
A forged part of the text was formerly used to support the existence of a form of the "congé d'élire"—royal power over investiture of bishops—in Anglo-Saxon England prior to the Norman Conquest.
The part that covers the years 1459–1486, called the Second Continuation, was written in April 1486, after Henry Tudor had become King Henry VII of England.
It was written someone who had access to information from the court of Richard III—described as being a doctor of canon law and member of Edward IV's council.
Some historians believe that author was John Russell, Bishop of Lincoln, who was Richard's Chancellor for most of his reign (until Richard dismissed him on 24 July 1485) but who now wanted to please the new king Henry.
Others conclude the work was written by a monk of Crowland who has edited a secular source.
Over the years, there has been confusion between the second and third continuators, and the fourth continuator claims not to know the identity of the third.
It is, in fact, the second continuator (covering the period 1459–1486) who claims to be writing in April 1486, and, sure enough, this section ends with the marriage of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York and the rebellion that followed.
This date ties in with the survival of a copy of "Titulus Regius" in the text, and Russell is known to have been at Crowland during April, 1486.
In communications and electronic engineering, an intermediate frequency (IF) is a frequency to which a carrier wave is shifted as an intermediate step in transmission or reception.
The intermediate frequency is created by mixing the carrier signal with a local oscillator signal in a process called heterodyning, resulting in a signal at the difference or beat frequency.
Intermediate frequencies are used in superheterodyne radio receivers, in which an incoming signal is shifted to an IF for amplification before final detection is done.
Conversion to an intermediate frequency is useful for several reasons.
When several stages of filters are used, they can all be set to a fixed frequency, which makes them easier to build and to tune.
Lower frequency transistors generally have higher gains so fewer stages are required.
It's easier to make sharply selective filters at lower fixed frequencies.
There may be several such stages of intermediate frequency in a superheterodyne receiver; two or three stages are called "double" (alternatively, "dual") or "triple" "conversion", respectively.
Intermediate frequencies are used for three general reasons.
At very high (gigahertz) frequencies, signal processing circuitry performs poorly.
Active devices such as transistors cannot deliver much amplification (gain).
Ordinary circuits using capacitors and inductors must be replaced with cumbersome high frequency techniques such as striplines and waveguides.
So a high frequency signal is converted to a lower IF for more convenient processing.
For example, in satellite dishes, the microwave downlink signal received by the dish is converted to a much lower IF at the dish, to allow a relatively inexpensive coaxial cable to carry the signal to the receiver inside the building.
Bringing the signal in at the original microwave frequency would require an expensive waveguide.
A second reason, in receivers that can be tuned to different frequencies, is to convert the various different frequencies of the stations to a common frequency for processing.
It is difficult to build multistage amplifiers, filters, and detectors that can have all stages track in tuning different frequencies, but it is comparatively easy to build tunable oscillators.
Superheterodyne receivers tune in different frequencies by adjusting the frequency of the local oscillator on the input stage, and all processing after that is done at the same fixed frequency, the IF.
Without using an IF, all the complicated filters and detectors in a radio or television would have to be tuned in unison each time the frequency was changed, as was necessary in the early tuned radio frequency receivers.
A more important advantage is that it gives the receiver a constant bandwidth over its tuning range.
The bandwidth of a filter is proportional to its center frequency.
In receivers like the TRF in which the filtering is done at the incoming RF frequency, as the receiver is tuned to higher frequencies its bandwidth increases.
The main reason for using an intermediate frequency is to improve frequency selectivity.
In communication circuits, a very common task is to separate out or extract signals or components of a signal that are close together in frequency.
This is called filtering.
Some examples are, picking up a radio station among several that are close in frequency, or extracting the chrominance subcarrier from a TV signal.
With all known filtering techniques the filter's bandwidth increases proportionately with the frequency.
So a narrower bandwidth and more selectivity can be achieved by converting the signal to a lower IF and performing the filtering at that frequency.
FM and television broadcasting with their narrow channel widths, as well as more modern telecommunications services such as cell phones and cable television, would be impossible without using frequency conversion.
Perhaps the most commonly used intermediate frequencies for broadcast receivers are around 455 kHz for AM receivers and 10.7 MHz for FM receivers.
In special purpose receivers other frequencies can be used.
A dual-conversion receiver may have two intermediate frequencies, a higher one to improve image rejection and a second, lower one, for desired selectivity.
A first intermediate frequency may even be higher than the input signal, so that all undesired responses can be easily filtered out by a fixed-tuned RF stage.
In a digital receiver, the analog to digital converter (ADC) operates at low sampling rates, so input RF must be mixed down to IF to be processed.
Intermediate frequency tends to be lower frequency range compared to the transmitted RF frequency.
However, the choices for the IF are most dependent on the available components such as mixer, filters, amplifiers and others that can operate at lower frequency.
There are other factors involved in deciding the IF frequency, because lower IF is susceptible to noise and higher IF can cause clock jitters.
Modern satellite television receivers use several intermediate frequencies.
The 500 television channels of a typical system are transmitted from the satellite to subscribers in the Ku microwave band, in two subbands of 10.7 - 11.7 and 11.7 - 12.75 GHz.
The downlink signal is received by a satellite dish.
In the box at the focus of the dish, called a low-noise block downconverter (LNB), each block of frequencies is converted to the IF range of 950 - 2150 MHz by two fixed frequency local oscillators at 9.75 and 10.6 GHz.
One of the two blocks is selected by a control signal from the set top box inside, which switches on one of the local oscillators.
This IF is carried into the building to the television receiver on a coaxial cable.
At the cable company's set top box, the signal is converted to a lower IF of 480 MHz for filtering, by a variable frequency oscillator.
This is sent through a 30 MHz bandpass filter, which selects the signal from one of the transponders on the satellite, which carries several channels.
Further processing selects the channel desired, demodulates it and sends the signal to the television.
An intermediate frequency was first used in the superheterodyne radio receiver, invented by American scientist Major Edwin Armstrong in 1918, during World War I.
A member of the Signal Corps, Armstrong was building radio direction finding equipment to track German military signals at the then-very high frequencies of 500 to 3500 kHz.
The triode vacuum tube amplifiers of the day would not amplify stably above 500 kHz, however, it was easy to get them to oscillate above that frequency.
Armstrong's solution was to set up an oscillator tube that would create a frequency near the incoming signal, and mix it with the incoming signal in a 'mixer' tube, creating a 'heterodyne' or signal at the lower difference frequency, where it could be amplified easily.
For example, to pick up a signal at 1500 kHz the local oscillator would be tuned to 1450 kHz.
Mixing the two created an intermediate frequency of 50 kHz, which was well within the capability of the tubes.
After the war, in 1920, Armstrong sold the patent for the superheterodyne to Westinghouse, who subsequently sold it to RCA.
The increased complexity of the superheterodyne circuit compared to earlier regenerative or tuned radio frequency receiver designs slowed its use, but the advantages of the intermediate frequency for selectivity and static rejection eventually won out; by 1930, most radios sold were 'superhets'.
During the development of radar in World War II, the superheterodyne principle was essential for downconversion of the very high radar frequencies to intermediate frequencies.
Since then, the superheterodyne circuit, with its intermediate frequency, has been used in virtually all radio receivers.

Guapas is a 2014 Argentine telenovela, produced by Pol-ka and aired by El Trece.
It stars Araceli Gonzalez, Isabel Macedo, Mercedes Morán, Carla Peterson and Florencia Bertotti.
Mónica (Mercedes Morán), Mey (Carla Peterson), Lorena (Florencia Bertotti), Laura (Isabel Mado) and Andrea (Araceli González) met in a protest against a bank that closed and confiscated their savings.
This incident forced them to give up on several personal projects.
Having become friends since then, they try to reorganize their lives.
Although the plot is focused on a group of women, the program is not similar either to "Sex and the City" or to "Desperate Housewives".
The cast defined it as a post-feminist program, as the characters are not angry with men, but rather seek romantic relations.
All the five actresses are important actresses in Argentine television, and most of them had worked together at previous telenovelas.
Although they are not personal friends, they commented that they have no problems working together, and do not foresee any internal problems like those suffered by "Farsantes". "Farsantes", the previous telenovela, had fights between the actors that led many of them to leave it before its conclusion.
The actress Mercedes Morán is the mother of the actress Mercedes Scápola, and their characters are mother and daughter in the plot as well.
Morán had encouraged her daughter to have her own acting career, and made a cameo with her in the 2012 telenovela "Graduados".
Both of them felt that "Guapas" was the appropriate time for a steady joint work.
Morán's character and that played by Dady Brieva are a couple; both actors had been lead actors in a previous telenovela, "Gasoleros".
Actress Araceli González returned to Pol-ka for this production.
She was the lead actress of "Carola Casini", one of the first telenovelas by Pol-ka.
She was married with Adrián Suar, president of Pol-ka, by then; they divorced and now both of them are married with other people.
González commented that she had known the company when it was just a medium enterprise, and that she has several relatives working in it.
The telenovela's main competitor is "Sres.
Papis", a telenovela aired by Telefe, with a mainly male cast.
On the first day it was aired, "Guapas" got 16.3 rating points, against 12 points for "Sres.
Papis".

El premio mayor, is a Mexican telenovela produced by Emilio Larrosa and written by Verónica Suárez and Alejandro Pohlenz.
Carlos Bonavides, Laura León, Sergio Goyri and Sasha Sokol star as the main protagonists, while Claudio Báez, Lorena Herrera, Martha Julia and Rodrigo Vidal as the main antagonists.
Huicho Domínguez (Carlos Bonavides), an uneducated, womanizing family man with two children in working-class Mexico, wins the grand prize jackpot ("el premio mayor") in the national lottery.
He and his family subsequently move into a large mansion and attempt to adjust to the newfound fame and customs associated with the upper class.
Huicho begins to fill his mansion with flamboyant items of bad taste, and wastes his money shamelessly.
The arc of the storyline revolves around him finding a way to balance the seductive aura of his recent wealth - and the beautiful gold-diggers that appear in his life - with not losing the love of his life, his wife Rebeca (Laura Leon).
Alongside them is Rosario (Sasha Sokol), a good and noble girl who was adopted by Rebeca and Huicho.
She is humiliated and mistreated by Huicho and his two children; however, Rebecca is good and sweet towards her and considers her as her own daughter.
Rosario has a boyfriend, (Rodrigo Vidal) Diego, who seems to be the ideal man who loves her too; however, he ends up becoming a villain when his boss, Jorge (Sergio Goyri), an unlucky journalist, falls for Rosario too.
The new, rich Huicho begins using his money to attract women and have numerous affairs with the support of his oldest son, Luis Gerardo (Sergio Sendel), who has always been interested in Rosario and becomes another obstacle between her and Jorge, who has two siblings, Lorenzo (Marcelo Buquet) and Sergio (Claudio Báez).
Lorenzo is noble and supports the relationship between Rosario and his brother, while Sergio is evil and jealous of Lorenzo.
Together with his sister-in-law and mistress Antonia (Lorena Herrera), who is Lorenzo's wife, and Sergio's daughter Deborah (Sussan Taunton), they are responsible for countless misdeeds, including making Jorge lose his family.
When Huicho's affairs come to light, mainly due to the sensual and interested Consuelo (Martha Julia), Lorenzo admits his own feelings for Rebeca, leading to devastating family conflicts that will shake the protagonists' faith in money as the solution to their problems.

Willis Russell (1844-July 1, 1875) was a Deputy United States Marshal who fought against William Smoot and his Ku Klux Klan chapter in Owen County, Kentucky.
Smoot and his followers conducted a bloody reign of terror in Franklin (Frankfort), Owen County, and Henry Counties.
Russell finally stopped them, though it cost him his life.
Willis Russell was born in 1844 in Monterey, Owen County, Kentucky, and grew up there.
During the American Civil War, he served as horse soldier in John Hunt Morgan's famous Confederate cavalry.
Bill Smoot was a figure who was popular among the local politicians.
He traveled in disguise with his father, John Smoot, and his brother, John C. Smoot, and was successful in recruiting new members to their Ku Klux Klan mob.
Bill Smoot's Ku Klux Klan controlled local lawmen, newspapers, and the courts.
Perry, the County Attorney, W. Monfort, the Commonwealth's Attorney, Judge Roberts, and the Police Judge of Owenton were either Klansmen themselves, or sympathetic to them.
Secret Service documents prove that the Sheriff of Owen County was a bona fide Klan member himself.
Some claim that even Democratic Governors John White Stevenson and Governor Preston Hopkins Leslie were partial to Bill Smoot's Klan too.
A man named Roberts was preparing for marriage when he was attacked and killed by a man named Salyers.
Robert's father, John B. Roberts, became so overwrought by his son's death that when he saw Salyers entering a store, Roberts shot Salyers dead.
Salyers was also preparing for his own marriage.
John B. Roberts was later shot and killed at the village of Gratz in Owen County by William "Bill" Smoot.
After many violent Klan outrages happened in Monterey and Guestville (Henry County) in 1870, Russell was assigned by the US Marshal service to investigate undercover.
Russell, who posed a cashier of a country store in northern Owen County, was approached by four men (George Hoover, John Robinson, a man named Lockart, and Benjamin Moreland) who asked Russell to join the "Kuklux" to drive "the negroes" and "all Radicals who were in favor of negroes" from Kentucky.
Russell declined.
Later, these men came to Russell's store and bought some sheets for their gowns and hoods.
They then set out to destroy the homes and property of the black residents in Stamping Ground, Scott County, since they had ignored a warning to leave the area.
During the raid, the Klansmen shot and killed one old man and wounded several others.
The defenders of one home fired back, killing one of the attackers, whose body was found in a ditch next to the road.
He was identified as a man named Foree, a school teacher who lived near Harper's Ferry, in Henry County.
Afterwards, John White Stevenson, Kentucky's 25th Governor (1867 – February 13, 1871), and a former Confederate sympathizer, authorized Russell to form his own militia to fight the Klansmen, though he later abandoned the idea.
In the spring of 1872, Russell moved to Gratz, an Owen County town on the Kentucky River.
In the winter of 1872, Smoot's Klan rode up to Russell's new home in Gratz late one night, armed, mounted, and disguised.
They demanded that Russell come out.
Russell recognized John Onan's voice and sensibly stayed indoors.
When Russell wouldn't come out, the Klansmen left.
Several citizens of Gratz came out to see what was going on, and the Klansmen fired at them, fortunately missing.
Shortly after that, Bill Smoot's Ku Klux Klan attacked Jordan Mosby and his son, who lived in a cabin on W. M. Bourne's farm in Henry County.
Mosby's son was shot, the bullet paralyzing him for of life.
Even though Mosby recognized the Klansmen, but none of them were ever arrested.
Early in 1873, the Smoot's men attacked the home of a 70-year-old Richard E. Williams in Guestville, in Henry County.
Willaims was wounded in the arm, but he managed to fight them off.
He had even managed to wounding Bill Smoot himself, though not mortally.
When Williams recovered, he went to Frankfort and appealed to Governor Preston Leslie, the 26th Governor of Kentucky (February 13, 1871 – August 31, 1875), also a Confederate sympathizer, for assistance.
Leslie offered a reward for the capture of those who attacked Williams.
One of those implicated was Harvie Grubbs.
Russell immediately went out to arrest Grubbs, but Bill Smoot was there, and he ordered Grubbs not to go along with Russell, until Russell stood in between Grubbs and Smoot, pulled his pistol, and forced Grubbs to go.
That night, Bill Smoot gathered 20 men, armed with shotguns and pistols, and followed Russell to Newcastle, intent on murdering Russell and the two young men Russell had employed as guards.
On the way to Newcastle, one of Russell's horses went lame, and so Russell asked Lewis Wilson, a local Black citizen, to loan them his horse which he did, which sealed Wilson's doom.
Russell was able to get to Newcastle, put Grubbs in jail, and left before Smoot could catch him.
Russell then went to Eminence expecting to take the first train to Frankfort.
Smoot, however, arrived at Eminence just moments after Russell did.
The town marshal told Russell to stay in his hotel.
The Marshal sent Russell's horses out to Frankfort Road, after dark, and Russell and his two guards slipped out, got on their horses, and rode them to Frankfort that night.
Russell contacted Preston Leslie about his ordeal, but Leslie said there wasn't anything he could do for Russell, because "the Legislature had virtually tied his hands".
Leslie reassured Russell that he wouldn't be harassed for arresting Harvie Grubbs, but this proved to be false.
Russell left Frankfort, and while on his road to his Monterey home, Smoot and his Klan party came out on the road, after Russell passed them, expecting to catch Russell.
After seeing their ambush fail, Smoot told them that he intended murder Russell and his two guards for the arrest of Grubbs.
Shortly afterwards, Grubbs was released from jail, and was never prosecuted for his participation in the shooting of Richard E. Williams.
In July 1873, the Ku Klux Klan murdered a colored man named Lewis Wilson.
Wilson, a Black man, resided on the farm of the widow of Mason Brown in Owen County, two miles from Gratz.
The Klan, 17 participants, went to Wilson's house in the middle of the night, broke open his door, and shot him dead.
After murdering Lewis Wilson, the Klan then burned his house to the ground.
Wilson, as he lay dying, told his neighbor the names of several of the party whom he had recognized.
The Courier-Journal reported in August 1873 that there had been at least 88 raids conducted by the Klan in less than a year.
A Courier-Journal correspondent was sent to Owen County, who informed Russell that Governor Leslie had offered a $500 reward for each of the 17 men implicated.
An 18-year-old who was a part of Smoot's raid on Lewis Wilson confessed to Russell that he a member of Smoot's gang, and gave Russell 17 names.
Russell arrested one of the men implicated by the 18-year-old informant, and he too made a confession, giving the same names.
Judge Roberts, the County Judge of Owen County, signed an affidavit to have 13 of the 17 names given, arrested.
The next day, after getting the affidavits of 13 of the local Klansmen, Russell arrested three of them, and put them in the Owenton jail.
When the other Klansmen heard that Russell had already arrested 3, they ran and hid out in the woods.
Three of them were taken to Indiana by Bill Smoot.
Governor Preston gave Russell permission to cross state lines to go after them.
Willis Russell caught up with Bill Smoot's gang and arrested John Onan in Smoot's presence.
Russell took Onan to Judge Roberts, who confessed that he was a part of the gang that murdered Lewis Wilson, and gave up three more names of men who rode with Bill Smoot.
The next day, Russell arrested Henry Triplett, who also confessed.
He reaffirmed the names Onan had given by giving the same names.
Onan was tried for murder in November 1873.
Onan had confessed to the crime, two former gang members turned State's evidence, and two other witnesses testified that Onan had confessed to the crime.
John Onan didn't even introduce any evidence on his own behalf.
But through the contrivance of the County Judge and the County Attorney, Onan was acquitted.
Russell's 18-year-old informant warned Russell of another of Smoot's planned raids on the Black residents of Twin Creek in Owen County.
After seeing Russell's men organized in Twin Creek, the Klan scurried away, never carrying out their attack on that town.
On a Tuesday, the informant said that the Klan was planning on killing William Plasters and Willis Russell next, on Thursday, and then go to Brown's Bottom, and kill all the Blacks there.
Plasters was able to leave his home, but the Klan tore up everything in his house.
The citizens of Gratz were ready for the Klan, so Smoot never went there.
Instead, he went to Owenton, and told one of the Walkers at his hotel that if Russell didn't stop arresting Klansmen, then Russell would be hung from the highest tree in the county.
Russell sent word that he planned on arresting every single one of the outlaws.
Early in 1874, a large band of Smoot's Klan was organized on Twin Creek near Gratz, and Russell contacted General Eli H. Murray in Louisville.
Willis Russell was then officially deputized as a United States Marshal by General Eli H. Murray.
After Russell was deputized as a US Marshall, Bill Smoot vowed publicly that he would not rest until he had run Russell and the Walkers out of Owen County.
Local authorities did nothing to restrain Smoot and his gang.
Sensing that he had enough witnesses ready to testify against the Henry and Owen County Klan, Russell requested a squad of soldiers, which both the state and federal governments gave to him.
Then Russell began arresting them all.
Russell arrested Jim Oskins, John Onan, Billy Walston, William Razor, Fielding Douthitt, Reuben Clements, Joseph Hoskins, and William Smoot in February 1874.
Russell put these eight culprits in a boat to put them in the Louisville jail (since some had escaped the Owenton jail previously).
On the way to Louisville, William Smoot was able to escape.
The other prisoners all posted bond to insure their appearance at the October term of the United States District Court in Louisville, and were released.
Bluford Woods, a man who had turned state's evidence at John Onan's trial, came up missing.
Russell assumed he had been murdered, since nobody had heard any news about his whereabouts.
Believing that law and order had been restored in Owen County, the federal troops left on May 3, 1874.
Then, on May 4, the next day, on a late rainy Monday afternoon, Bill Smoot and his brother John C. Smoot shot James M. Walker in the back in the main street in Owenton, Kentucky.
James was walking to his brother William's Walker Hotel, and was shot down from two rifles in the upper windows of the Hill Hotel.
James dropped dead immediately.
After murdering James M. Walker, about 40 Klan members started yelling all over town.
The Klansmen then literally riddled his dead body with many bullets blasting out of their rifles and pistols.
Some of the Klan brazenly shot James' dead body from the courthouse lawn.
Although the Sheriff was in town with tjree of his deputies, the Smoots and their men reloaded their pistols and leisurely walked out of Owenton.
The Town Marshal tried to arrest Smoot, but they threatened his life, and so he backed down.
James, 31, had three children, and a wife, Alice Grover Walker, at home.
It was Alice and James' 8th anniversary.
Alice buried her husband on her father's farm.
James and William's brother, F. R. ("Dock") Walker, was severely wounded in the arm.
The federal troops came back, but they couldn't find Smoot or any of his men, who were presumably hiding in the mountainous forests of Owen County.
On July 1, again, the federal troops left Owen County.
Smoot's Ku Klux Klan became more emboldened, and they made a raid on an old man named Hayden living at Elkhorn.
Two months later, at a Masonic barbecue given in Monterey, Green Barr, a Klan member, slipped up behind Charles Walker, one of James' brothers, and tried to shoot him in the back, but wasn't able to because of the timely interference of Thomas Walker.
William H. Walker's life was threatened, and so he sold his hotel in Owenton, and prepared to move away.
On election day, Green Barr came to Monterey.
While hiding in the woods, he shot at Henry Triplett, who had testified against the Klan members for Russell in US District Court.
Green Barr later accused Russell of threatening to murder him, and so he swore out a warrant against Russell and Henry Triplett.
Russell showed up for the court case, but none of the prosecuting witnesses came.
The court date was postponed until August 22.
On Saturday, August 22, the day set for the trial of Barr and Triplett, Barr sent Russell word through the Owen County Constable that he was coming to town with a hundred men. 15 to 20 more armed men of the Klan marched towards Monterey behind Perry.
Green Barr, one of the Smoots, Simon Margoyles, and George T. Mefford were all a part of the incoming gang.
Russell went to see Tom and Charles Walker at Tucker's Hotel.
Then the three men started to walk towards Russell's house, where most of his guards were stationed.
When the Walkers and Russell passed Hardin's store, they saw George T. Mefford standing nearby with his hand on his pistol.
When Russell and the Walkers got to the corner of the store, Mefford pulled his pistol, and both of the Walker boys fired.
Mefford ran, and as Russell pursued him, William Hall, one of the gang members, shot at Russel.
After the shootout, Mefford mounted his horse, following behind another, and left Monterey, riding in the direction of the Klan along the road between Monterey and Owenton.
Perry, the County Attorney who rode with the Klansmen, accused one of Russell's men of shooting at him.
Russell got affidavits from several citizens disproving Perry's claims.
On his return to Owenton, Perry swore out writs for Russell, the two Walker boys, and others.
George T. Mefford swore out a warrant against Willis Russell, Thomas M. Walker, William Graves, Charles Walker, and John Wilson for attempting to kill Mefford.
Perry also issued a warrant for Willis Russell, Thomas M. Walker, Charles Walker, James Russell, Thomas Wilson, John Wilson, William Graves and Henry Triplett for the shooting that occurred on August 10, 1874.
John Smoot, Bill's father, was shot, and John C. Smoot, Bill's brother was killed.
John Smoot said that he "saw the two Walkers, Willis Russell and a man named Wilson all fire upon me.
I do not know who hit me, but they all fired.
I saw them clearly; they were not further off than from this bed to that wall."
Perry, the County Attorney, was able to get the Grand Jury to successfully indict all of those accused.
The Police Judge of Owenton who issued those writs was himself a Klansman.
Before the Sheriff came to arrest Russell and company, Bill Smoot ordered Perry to request the state's militia from Governor Preston Leslie to settle a "state of riot and rebellion."
At the same time, Russell asked the federal marshal to send troops to see that he got a fair trial.
The Sheriff of Owen County confronted Russell, saying that he had a warrant out for his arrest.
Russell showed him his credentials as a United States Marshal, but the Sheriff refused to recognize them.
Russell refused to surrender to him because he knew that would be suicide.
The next day the Sheriff came with a posse of over thirty men, most of whom who had no authority.
At least twenty-five of the Sheriff's men were known by him to be Ku Klux Klan members.
The Klansmen were as follows: Mose Webster, with six men; William and Jim Hoskins, with sixteen men; Jim Hoskins, who was under indictment in Federal court for Klan activities, with five or six men; Bill Smoot, with eighteen or twenty men, who was under federal indictment his clan activities, and before the Owen Circuit Court for the murder of James M. Walker; and Dick New, with 20 men.
Many of the men with the Sheriff hadn't been in Owen County for more than a year.
The State's troops arrived at about the same time as the Sheriff's (mostly Klan) posse did.
While the State's troops said they intended to arrest all those involved, they didn't arrest Smoot or Hoskins or their men.
There were over a hundred men chasing Russell, until General Eli H. Murray's federal troops arrived just in the nick of time.
In a letter penned from Russell to Murray, he wrote: In October 1874, a federal grand jury indicted several Klansmen, but then dismissed all charges against them when every prosecution witness disappeared.
They probably had been murdered by the Klan.
Raids by the Klan resumed immediately.
Toward the end of October, a mob invaded eastern Shelby County, whipped three Black men, and threatened their employer, Thomas Ford, with violence if he persisted in hiring black workers.
That same month, Klansmen murdered a teenage black girl and whipped several field hands.
Klanmen burned a black church in Todd County on February 16, 1875.
In June 1875, the State of Kentucky shelled out thousands of dollars in a court case against Russell.
GC Wharton signed a $2,000 check for Alexander and Dickinson, the lawyers who were prosecuting the case of "Commonwealth versus Willis Russell, et al".
More checks were signed for witnesses against Russell, traveling expenses for JH Dorman, who provided "services" for the Commonwealth, and newspaper men (for the "Louisville Commercial", and Graham and Hardacre) were also paid by the State of Kentucky.
On July 1, 1875, Deputy U.S.
Marshal Willis Russell was murdered late at night by an assassin who fired a load of buckshot through the window as Russell was sitting in his home.
A member of the Klan, John W. Brothers, was arrested and turned State's evidence by telling on everybody else involved in Klan activity.
A dozen of the Klan members had warrants issued against them, but only four—Bill Smoot, John Onan, Meffert, and A. W. Hall—were captured.
The four Klansmen finally faced trial in November 1875.
They were found guilty of conspiring against the government by intimidating United States Marshall Willis Russell, but were not found guilty not of his murder.
When sentencing the men, Judge Emmons was apologetic, because even though a jury had found them guilty, Emmons believed they were honest law-abiding citizens.
On November 13, 1875, Judge Emmons sentenced Bill Smoot to five years in the penitentiary in Frankfort.
Onan received three years.
Meffert escaped prison time on the grounds that he had been injured while pursuing the marshal.
A. W. Hall was found not guilty.
Klan raids continued in Kentucky through December 1875.
Tom Walker testified against Smoot, and after the trial, moved out west, became wealthy, and died an old man.
On March 3, 1877, President Ulysses S. Grant pardoned W.F.
Smoot, Simon Margolyes, and Davis Cox.
Smoot served less than a year and a half of his five-year prison sentence.
Hans Klenk (28 October 1919 in Künzelsau – 24 March 2009 in Vellberg) was a racing driver from Germany.
He participated in one World Championship Grand Prix on 3 August 1952 and did not score any championship points.
Manhua are Chinese comics produced in China and the greater region of Sinosphere.
The word "manhua", literally "impromptu sketches", is originally an 18th-century term used in Chinese literati painting.
It became popular in Japan as manga in the late 18th century.
Feng Zikai, in his 1925 series of cartoons entitled "Zikai Manhua", reintroduced the term into Chinese in the modern sense.
The oldest surviving examples of Chinese drawings are stone reliefs from the 11th century BC and pottery from 5000 to 3000 B.C.
Other examples include symbolic brush drawings from the Ming Dynasty, a satirical drawing titled "Peacocks" by the early Qing Dynasty artist Zhu Da, and a work called "Ghosts' Farce Pictures" from around 1771 by Luo Liang-feng.
Chinese manhua was born in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, roughly during the years 1867 to 1927.
The introduction of lithographic printing methods derived from the West was a critical step in expanding the art in the early 20th century.
Beginning in the 1870s, satirical drawings appeared in newspapers and periodicals.
By the 1920s palm-sized picture books like Lianhuanhua were popular in Shanghai.
They are considered the predecessor of modern-day manhua.
One of the first magazines of satirical cartoons came from the United Kingdom entitled "The China Punch".
The first piece drawn by a person of Chinese nationality was "The Situation in the Far East" from Tse Tsan-tai in 1899, printed in Japan.
Sun Yat-Sen established the Republic of China in 1911 using Hong Kong's manhua to circulate anti-Qing propaganda.
Some of the manhua that mirrored the early struggles of the transitional political and war periods were "The True Record" and "Renjian Pictorial".
Up until the establishment of the Shanghai Sketch Society in 1927, all prior works were Lianhuanhua or loose collections of materials.
The first successful manhua magazine, "Shanghai Sketch" (or "Shanghai Manhua") appeared in 1928.
Between 1934 and 1937 about 17 manhua magazines were published in Shanghai.
This format would once again be put to propaganda use with the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War.
By the time the Japanese occupied Hong Kong in 1941, all manhua activities had stopped.
With the surrender of the Japanese in 1945, political mayhem between Chinese Nationalists and Communists took place.
One of the critical manhua, "This Is a Cartoon Era" by Renjian Huahui made note of the political backdrop at the time.
One of the most popular and enduring comics of this period was Zhang Leping's "Sanmao", first published in 1935.
The rise of Chinese immigration turned Hong Kong into the main manhua-ready market, especially with the baby boom generation of children.
The most influential manhua magazine for adults was the 1956 "Cartoons World", which fueled the best-selling Uncle Choi.
The availability of Japanese and Taiwanese comics challenged the local industry, selling at a pirated bargain price of 10 cents.
Manhua like "Old Master Q" were needed to revitalize the local industry.
The arrival of television in the 1970s was a changing point.
Bruce Lee's films dominated the era and his popularity launched a new wave of Kung Fu manhua.
The explicit violence helped sell comic books, and the Government of Hong Kong intervened with the Indecent Publication Law in 1975. "Little Rascals" was one of the pieces which absorbed all the social changes.
The materials would also bloom in the 90s with work like McMug and three-part stories like "Teddy Boy", "Portland Street" and "Red Light District".
Since the 1950s, Hong Kong's manhua market has been separate from that of mainland China. "Si loin et si proche", by Chinese writer and illustrator Xiao Bai, won the Gold Award at the 4th International Manga Award in 2011.
Several other manhua have also won the Silver and Bronze Awards at the International Manga Award.
In the second half of the 2000s and early 2010s, various Chinese cartoonists began using social media to spread satirical strips and cartoons online.
Print publishing, being strictly controlled in China, is slowly being traded in for microblogging websites such as Sina Weibo and Douban, where manhua can reach a wide audience while subject to less editorial control.
Despite China being a major consumer of comics for decades, the medium has never been taken as "serious works of art".
R. Martin of "The Comics Journal" describes the Chinese outlook on comics as "pulpy imitations of films".
Furthermore, China strictly controls the publishing of comics, and as a result, cartoonists faced difficulty reaching a large audience.
Many cartoonists in the late 2000s began self-publishing their work on social media instead of attempting to issue paper editions.
Websites such as Douban (2005) and Sina Weibo (2009) are popular venues for web manhua and webcomics.
The Taipei International Comics and Animation Festival celebrated a coming "webcomics era" in 2015.
With increased smartphone usage with a younger generation, web manhua, webcomics, and webtoons are expected to become more popular.
With an increasing prevalence of Chinese-language online comic platforms, young artists have more opportunities to publish their work and gain a reputation.
In the second half of the 2010s, South Korean webtoons and webtoon platforms have become increasingly popular in China.
In 2016, two manhua have been adapted into anime television series: "Yi Ren Zhi Xia" and "Soul Buster".
Another series, "Bloodivores", based on a web manhua, will start airing on October 1, 2016.
Another series, "The Silver Guardian", is scheduled to premiere in 2017.
In 1925, the political work of Feng Zikai published a collection entitled "Zi-Kai Manhua" in "Wenxue Zhoubao" (Literature Weekly).
While the term ""manhua"" had existed before when borrowed from Japanese ""manga"", this particular publication took precedence over the many other description of cartoon arts that came before it.
As a result, the term manhua became associated with Chinese comic materials.
The Chinese characters for manhua are identical for those used in Japanese manga and Korean manhwa.
Someone who draws or writes manhua is referred to as a "manhuajia" .
Before the official terminology was established, the art form was known by several names.
Today's manhua are simply distinguished by four categories.
Modern Chinese-style manhua characteristics is credited to the breakthrough art work of the 1982 "".
It had innovative, realistic drawings with details resembling real people.
Most manhua work from the 1800s to the 1930s contained characters that appeared serious.
The cultural openness in Hong Kong brought the translation of American Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Pinocchio in the 1950s, demonstrating western influence in local work like "Little Angeli" in 1954.
The influx of translated Japanese manga of the 60s, as well as televised anime in Hong Kong also made a significant impression.
Unlike manga, manhua comes in full color with some panels rendered entirely in painting for the single issue format.
Depending on the region where it's created, manhua can have differences in the way it is formatted and presented.
Besides the use of traditional and simplified Chinese characters, manhua can also be read differently depending on where it's from.
Manhua from mainland China is read from left-to-right like Western comics and Korean manhwa while manhua from Taiwan and Hong Kong is read from right-to-left like Japanese manga.
The same applies to the text in its original Chinese.
Text in manhua from mainland China is placed horizontally and read from left-to-right while in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the text is placed vertically going down and is read from right-to-left.
This is due to the changes that the Chinese communist government made to the way Chinese text is written and read to bring it more align to the way it's done in the West.
Since Taiwan and Hong Kong have some autonomy from the Chinese government, they have stuck to their traditional ways of formatting and writing.
Digital manhua, known as web manhua, are a growing art form in China, where traditionally published manhua are in decline.
Web manhua are posted on social media and web manhua portals, which serve as a lower bar of entry than the strictly controlled print publication outlets in the country.
Though little money is currently made through online manhua in China, the medium has become popular due to ease of uploading and publishing titles, color publication, and free reading access.
Some popular web manhua sites include QQ Comic and U17.
In recent years, several Chinese web manhua have been adapted into animated series, with some in co-production with the Japanese animation industry.
As microblogging and webcomics were gaining popularity in China, the form was increasingly used for political activism and satire.
Despite China being a major consumer of comics for decades, the medium has never been taken as "serious works of art".
R. Martin of "The Comics Journal" describes the Chinese outlook on comics as "pulpy imitations of films".
Furthermore, China strictly controls the publishing of comics, and as a result, cartoonists faced difficulty reaching a large audience.
Many cartoonists in the late 2000s began self-publishing their work on social media instead of attempting to issue paper editions.
Websites such as Douban (2005) and Sina Weibo (2009) are popular venues for webcomics. he Taipei International Comics and Animation Festival celebrated a coming "webcomics era" in 2015.
With increased smartphone usage with a younger generation, webcomics featuring a scrollable infinite canvas are expected to become more popular.
With an increasing prevalence of Chinese-language webcomic portals, young artists have more opportunities to publish their work and gain a reputation.
In the second half of the 2010s, South Korean webcomics and webtoon platforms have become increasingly popular in China.
Cartoonists such as Kuang Biao and Rebel Pepper make use of the Internet to criticize the Communist Party and its leaders.
Communist propaganda and figures such as Lei Feng are openly mocked on microblogs and in online cartoons, despite efforts of censorship by the Chinese government.
David Bandurski, a researcher with the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project, stated that social media has "dramatically changed the environment for cartoonists [as] they now have a really good platform to find an audience."
Chinese animator Pi San criticized internet companies and web portals for being "pretty cowardly" and "too sensitive", as they take on the role of first line of defense through self-censorship.
Rebel Pepper's account on Sina Weibo, where he posts his satiral cartoons, had been deleted over 180 times by 2012.
Blogging websites such as Sina Weibo are also highly censored by the Chinese government.
Reuters reported in September 2013 that about 150 graduates, all male, were employed to censor Sina Weibo day and night, and automatic censors processed around three million posts per day.
A research team from Rice University, Texas, stated that they saw "a fairly sophisticated system, where human power is amplified by computer automation, capable of removing sensitive posts within minutes."
Images censored from Sina Weibo include a portrait of Mao Zedong wearing a pollution mask, a photo compilation identifying the expensive watches on the wrists of supposedly low-waged local officials, and criticism on police action, censorship in education, and the one child policy.
Webtoons have grown in popularity in China as another form to consume and produce manhua in the country thanks in part to the popularity of South Korean webtoons.
Microblogging platforms Sina Weibo and Tencent have also offered webtoons on their digital manhua sites alongside web manhua.
Also Beijing-based platform Kuaikan Manhua specialises in artwork targeting young readers.
Several of these manhuas have later been translated into various languages.
While webtoon portals in mainland China are mainly run by the big internet companies, webtoon portals in Taiwan are offered and operated by big webtoon publishers outside the country like Comico, and Naver (under the Line brand).
China Taiwan Chinese Animation and Comic Publisher Association secretary-general Roger Kao stated in 2015 that comic book sales were strongly in decline.
The Taiwanese comics industry expects webcomics to prosper financially, though no accurate figures exist as of yet.
Prize-winning cartoonists such as Chung Yun-de and Yeh Yu-tung were forced to turn to webcomics as their monthly income was too low to live from.
Beijing cartoonist Bu Er Miao sells her webcomic "Electric Cat and Lightning Dog" on Douban's eBook service for 1.99 CNY (roughly 0.30 USD).
When asked about whether she makes a profit off of her webcomic, Miao described the 1.79 CNY she makes per comic sold as "an amount of money that if you saw it on the street, no one would bother to pick it up."
Political cartoonist Liu "Big Corpse Brother" Jun had over 130,000 followers on Sina Weibo in December 2013, and Kuang Biao has his work appear both online and in various print journals.
The Chinese webcomic "One Hundred Thousand Bad Jokes" received a film adaptation of the same name released in 2014.
In 2016, two anime series based on Chinese web manhua were broadcast: "", based on "Yi Ren Zhi Xia" by Dong Man Tang and "Bloodivores", based on a web manhua by Bai Xiao.
An animated series adaptation of a web manhua by Pingzi, "Spiritpact", has been released in China.
A Chinese-Japanese animated series based on "Chōyū Sekai" is scheduled to air in 2017.
Another series, "The Silver Guardian", based on "Yín Zhī Shǒu Mù Rén", premiered in 2017.
Kakao, operating the Korean webtoon portal Daum Webtoon, has collaborated with the Chinese Huace Group in order to produce live-action, Chinese language films and television dramas based on South Korean webtoons.
Eilert Lund Sundt (8 August 1817 – 13 June 1875) was a Norwegian theologist and sociologist, known for his work on mortality, marriage and other subjects among the working class.
He was born in Farsund as a son of Lars Mortensen Sundt (1762–1850) and Karen Bing Drejer (1777–1865).
He was a distant descendant of Peter Drejer.
He was a third cousin of Christian Sundt, uncle of Lauritz and Karen Sundt, granduncle of Vigleik, Halfdan and Harald Sundt, and great-granduncle of Leif Sundt Rode.
His father was a ship captain, and he was born into a large family of 13 children.
All the children worked to help make ends meet.
Farsund at that time had many seamen, small fishermen and chandlers.
This provided his initial exposure to the ideas which he came to examine extensively later in his life: poverty, overpopulation and the work issues associated with the transition from an older farm culture to 19th century business and industry.
In February 1859 he married Nicoline Conradine Hansen (1822–81), a daughter of Maurits Christopher Hansen.
They had the son Einar Sundt, a publisher.
In 1835 he began his studies in Kristiania, but came back to Farsund in 1838 and became a teacher.
He resumed his studies in Kristiania in 1841.
There he met and became close friends with Henrik Wergeland, who was also born and raised in Agder.
When Henrik Wergeland was buried in 1845, Eilert Sundt led the student contingent and spoke at the funeral on their behalf.
His interests in sociology were broad.
He studied prison conditions, customs and treatment of Gypsies, causes of death, the evils of married life in Norway, conditions of prostitutes, suicide, fishery and forestry workers' living and working conditions, building customs, shipping practices, household cleanliness and administration of poverty laws.
A man of his times, he also was interested in ethnography, ethnology, architecture, and demography, linguistics (with special emphasis on the dialects of Norwegian).
From 1857 to 1866 Eilert Sundt was editor for "Folkevennen" ("Friend of the People"), for which he wrote a number of the more important articles.
His work served to inform many of the authors of Norwegian literature in their transition to a socially aware realism at the close of the 19th century.
Eilert Sundt served as the parish priest in Eidsvoll from 1869, and he died there in 1875.
Two of his works were selected for the Norwegian Sociology Canon in 2009–2011.
Pallas's pika ("Ochotona pallasi"), also known as the Mongolian pika, is a species of small mammals in the pika family, Ochotonidae.
It is found mainly in the mountains of western Mongolia.
Pallas's pika can range from anywhere between in weight and can grow up to long.
Pallas's pikas have round bodies, very short limbs, and small rounded ears.
They will also have different pelage coloration depending on the time of the year.
They become lighter in the summer and much darker in the winter.
O. p. "pallasi" can be geographically separated from the other three subspecies.
O. p. "pallasi" is largely distributed in Kazakhstan and the other large group O. p. "pricei", are distributed along Mongolia and bordering territories.
The range for both these groups extends all the way between the Betpak Dala Desert located in Kazakhastan to the Helan Shan Range.
The remaining two, which have been little-studied, O. p. "argentata" collected mostly at the Helan Shan Range and the O. p. "sunidica" found mostly near the Chinese-Mongolian border, both of which found in rocky habitats with very restricted ranges.
Pallas's pikas are much smaller in body size than other herbivores that usually share the same environment.
Their body size allows them to consume more of the lower level vegetation, giving them more of an advantage over larger herbivores, such as livestock.
Like other pikas, Pallas's pika is herbivorous and saves grass in the summer to eat in the winter.
They often construct haypiles with this stash, but some populations prefer to keep their stores under rocks.
Their diet consists mostly of grasses, however their diet does range in flowers as well as stems.
Another form of further nutrition is the consumption of cecotrophs.
Cecotrophs are the evacuated cecal contents that come from the pika.
Pallas's pika mostly are found in more arid type climates.
They have shown to play a role in not only seed dispersal and vegetation, but the alteration of site conditions.
This alteration through burrowing, has led to plant growth and increased soil nutrients.
This is a clear representation of allogenic ecosystem engineering.
Pallas's pikas are only monogamous.
Mating is between male and females.
Their litter size contains an average of 5 young and around 2.7 litters per year.
Reproduction will only occur in the summer.
Most young by day 19 are able to consume solid food and are sexually mature as soon as 4 weeks.
Pallas’s pikas reproduce during the summer months.
They have an average of 2.7 litters per year, each with an average of 5 young.
The Pallas's Pika and many other subspecies show a mechanism called microbial nitrogen fixation.
This is a very important mechanism consisting of an isolation of a bacterial community in the cecum and colon of the Pika called the nifH gene.
Since Pallas's pika's diet consist of such poor feed, they need to have an adaptation such as this in order to provide the essential amino acids to their diet.
These essential amino acids are supplied by the microorganisms produced by microbial nitrogen fixations.
There are four defined taxa: O. p. "pallasi", O. p. "pricei", O. p. "sunidica", and O. "argentata".
Mitochondrial studies show that the two larger defined taxa of O. pallasi are paraphyletic to O. "argentata".
However, morphometric data shows that the taxa O. p "pricei" and O. p. "pallasii" show similar traits to one other than to O. "argentata".
O. "argentata" differ in that they show a rufous type coloration in the summer and a more silver type coloration in the winter.
As a species, Pallas's pika is common.
However, "O. p. hamica", "O. p. helanshanensis" and "O. p. sundica" are rated as "critically endangered" and "endangered", respectively, on the IUCN Red List.

Thomas Biketi (born 31 December 1983 in Kenya) is a Kenyan former footballer.
He has plied his trade in a variety of countries- Kenya, Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Nepal.
Helping Jawalkhel Youth Club to a three-match winning streak in the Nepal National League, Biketi's club descended to fourth place by the end of the season, accruing 16 points in total.
Alongside Gerald Mukonza, the defender was poised to join Karuturi Sports F.C. in January 2012 but the transfer was delayed because Biketi was still competing for promotion in the play-offs for Jawalkhel Youth Club.
Ultimately, by late February, the Kenyan sealed the move, making his debut in a 2-0 victory over Chemelil Sugar F.C. in which he was complimented by his coach.
Before his debut, Biketi was supposed to have adapted to the clubs style of play and environment.

The 4th Parapan American Games took place from November 12 to 20 in Guadalajara, Mexico.
The Games are an international multi-sport event for athletes with a physical disability.
The Games were held 20 days after the 2011 Pan American Games began.
The opening and closing ceremonies were produced by FiveCurrents.
A Guadalajara reporter said "The area is rough.
It's just this side of being on the wrong side of the tracks.
But it's not far from the theatre area or the downtown with some of the nicer, old colonial hotels, and the city hopes that the Villa Panamericana can rejuvenate the downtown historical area."
The $300 million Guggenheim Guadalajara will also be nearby.
The city would have 22,000 hotel rooms by 2011, a new bus rapid transit system, Macrobus, that would run through the Calzada Independencia, and the Centro Cultural Metropolitano, an ambitious project of the Universidad de Guadalajara, which includes a 10,000-seat performing arts auditorium (Auditorio Telmex), the new public library of the state of Jalisco, among other buildings. 24 nations will be participating in the Games.

Shane O'Connor (born November 15, 1973) is an alpine skier from Ireland.
He competed for Ireland at the 2010 Winter Olympics finishing 45th in the slalom.
Shane O’Connor is an ex-alpine ski racer who represented Ireland in five World Championships and one Winter Olympic Games.
Shane was born in Dublin in 1973 and began his skiing career at the age of five having been introduced to snowsports through his parents and a family holiday to Austria.
Shane quickly developed a love for the sport and became a regular at the Ski Club of Ireland kinder garden before graduating, aged 7 to the children’s race training program.
Regular training at the Ski Club of Ireland was interspersed with annual trips abroad to ski in Europe and by his early teens Shane had become one of the foremost Irish children racers regularly competing on the UK dry ski slope circuit and in regional snow races across France’s ski resorts.
At age 18 Shane was selected as a member of the very first Irish team to compete at the 1993 World Alpine Ski Championship in Morioka, Japan.
Two years later Shane was again selected as part of the Irish team this time to compete in the 1995 World Alpine Ski Championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Unfortunately, these championships were postponed to 1996 due to a lack of snow.
In the same year, Shane played with the Dublin U21 team competing against Wexford in the Leinster championship and it was during this time that he developed a recurring problem with his knee which resulted in him missing the World Championships in 1996 and culminated in a number of years away from competition ski racing.
In late 1997 Shane was advised to retire from both Ski Racing and Hurling due to extensive wear on the knee joint.
Thankfully after close to three years exploring different treatment options Shane managed to return to both sports and in 2003, 10 years after first representing Ireland at a World Championships, he was selected to represent Ireland at the World Alpine Ski Championships in St. Moritz, Switzerland.
Shane competed in an additional three World Alpine Ski Championships – Bormio (Italy) in 2005, Are (Sweden) in 2007 and Val d’Isere (France) in 2009.
Shane always had the dream of representing Ireland at a Winter Olympic Games and for many years skirted around Olympic qualification but just couldn’t turn his dream into a reality.
It was at the 2007 World Championships that a US coach, partnered with Ireland, finally put Shane on the road to securing his dream and it was at the 2009 World Championships that Shane secured the first of his qualifying results.
This was followed quickly with additional qualifying results before the end of the 2009 season cementing Shane’s selection for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, Canada.
On 27 February 2010, Shane finally realised his dream and pushed out of the start gate in the Slalom at the Vancouver Winter Olympic Games finishing a credible 45th from a field of 102 racers.
Although never achieving the success levels of his older brother Shane, living his life in his shadow, his little known brother Colm, affectionately known as "The Toe" was in fact also recognised on the world stage.
In 2008 Colm was victorious in achieving the Guinness Book of Records world record human toe length.
This is a list of bus routes operated by the San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans) primarily in San Mateo County of the San Francisco Bay Area, in the state of California.

Kent Durden (1937–2007) was an American wildlife photographer, documentary producer and writer.
He is widely known for the non-fiction book "Gifts of an Eagle", published by Simon and Schuster in 1971.
He followed this book with the fictional "Flight to Freedom" (1974) and the memoir "A Fine and Peaceful Kingdom" (1975).
Kent worked with his father Ed Durden while they raised, studied and filmed a golden eagle named Lady.
When they first got Lady Kent was 18 years old.
Lady appeared in a number of TV and films during the 16 years she was with the Durdens.
Most notably Disney's Grand Canyon, The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle and a number of Lassie episodes.
Kent began his own nature film making business in the 60's and 70's.

He also showed his film on lecture tours for the National Audubon Society for many years.
In 1971 Kent wrote the book "Gifts of an Eagle".
The book tells the story of all that he and his father learned about golden eagles.
It also documents the strong relationship between Ed and Lady.
This book and the documentary film that followed had a major impact on eagle studies.
The footage of Lady's eggs hatching was the first time an eagle was filmed nesting in captivity.
Regional Cancer Centres (RCCs) are cancer care hospitals and research institutes operating in India under the joint control and funding of the Government of India and the respective state governments.
The name 'regional' because each of these institutions cater to a designated region, usually a number of districts in the country.
There are presently 25 such centres spanning all the states and union territories of India.
This system works under the "National Cancer Control Programme" which started in 1975 under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India).
The scheme originally started with 5 RCCs for 5 designated regions of the nation.
Later this number was increased in steps.
The present number of RCCs is more than 25 and the union government is planning to assign RCC status to more regional cancer hospitals.
In 2011, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy looked to have Malabar Cancer Centre upgraded to the level of a regional cancer centre.
Regional Cancer Centres, presently approved and funded by the central government are:
The Ancient City of Aleppo is the historic city centre of Aleppo, Syria.
Before the Syrian Civil War, many districts of the ancient city remained essentially unchanged since its construction during the 12th to the 16th century.
Being subjected to constant invasions and political instability, the inhabitants of the city were forced to build cell-like quarters and districts that were socially and economically independent.
Each district was characterized by the religious and ethnic characteristics of its inhabitants.
The Old City of Aleppo – composed of the ancient city within the walls and the old cell-like quarters outside the walls – has an approximate area of , housing more than 120,000 residents.
Characterized by its large mansions, narrow alleys, covered souqs and ancient caravanserais, the Ancient City of Aleppo became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986.
Many sections in the Al-Madina Souq and other medieval buildings in the ancient city were destroyed and ruined or burnt as a result of clashes between the Syrian Arab Army and the rebel forces of Jabhat al-Nusra, in what is called the Battle of Aleppo, launched by the opposition JN armed groups on 25 September 2012.
In February 2014, the opposition groups of the Islamic Front claimed responsibility for destroying a series of major historic buildings being used as fortified bases by the Syrian Army in the old city including the justice palace, the Carlton hotel and the old building of the city council. 30% of the Ancient City of Aleppo has been destroyed in the fighting.
Lying on the left bank of Queiq River the ancient city was surrounded by a circle of eight hills surrounding a prominent central hill on which the castle (originally a temple dating to the 2nd millennium BC) was erected in the shape of an acropolis.
The radius of the circle is about .
The hills are Tell as-Sawda, Tell ʕāysha, Tell as-Sett, Tell al-Yāsmīn (Al-ʕaqaba), Tell al-Ansāri (Yārūqiyya), ʕan at-Tall, al-Jallūm, Baḥsīta.
With an approximate area of , the ancient city was enclosed within a historic wall of in circuit that was last rebuilt by the Mamlukes.
The wall has since disappeared in its most parts.
It had nine gates (5 of them are well preserved) and was surrounded by a broad deep ditch.
The newer "Jdeydeh" quarters of the old city were first built by the Christians during the early 15th century in the northern suburbs of the ancient city, after the Mongol withdrawal from Aleppo.
Jdeydeh is one of the finest examples of a cell-like quarter in Aleppo.
As a result of the economic development, many other quarters were established outside the walls of the ancient city during the 15th and 16th centuries.
Throughout its history, Aleppo has been part of the following states: Aleppo has scarcely been touched by archaeologists, since the modern city occupies its ancient site.
Aleppo appears in historical records as an important city much earlier than Damascus.
The first record of Aleppo may from the third millennium BC if the identification of Aleppo as Armi, a city-state closely related to Ebla is correct.
Armi has also been identified with the modern Tell Bazi.
Giovanni Pettinato describes Armi as Ebla's alter ego.
Naram-Sin of Akkad (or his grandfather Sargon) destroyed both Ebla and Arman in the 23rd century BC.
In the Old Babylonian period, Aleppo's name appears as Ḥalab (Ḥalba) for the first time.
Aleppo was the capital of the important Amorite dynasty of Yamḥad.
The kingdom of Yamḥad (ca. 1800-1600 BC), alternatively known as the 'land of Ḥalab,' was the most powerful in the Near East at the time.
Yamḥad was destroyed by the Hittites under Mursilis I in the 16th century BC.
However, Aleppo soon resumed its leading role in Syria when the Hittite power in the region waned due to internal strife.
Taking advantage of the power vacuum in the region, Parshatatar, king of the Hurrian kingdom of Mitanni, conquered Aleppo in the 15th century BC.
Subsequently, Aleppo found itself on the frontline in the struggle between the Mitanni and the Hittites and Egypt.
The Hittite Suppiluliumas I permanently defeated Mitanni and conquered Aleppo in the 14th century BC.
Aleppo had cultic importance to the Hittites for being the center of worship of the Storm-God.
When the Hittite kingdom collapsed in the 12th century BC, Aleppo became part of the Syro-Hittite kingdom of Palistin, then the Aramaean Syro-Hittite kingdom of Bit Agusi (which had its capital at Arpad), it stayed part of that kingdom until conquered by the Assyrians In the 9th century BC, and became part of the Neo-Assyrian Empire until the late 7th century BC, before passing through the hands of the Neo-Babylonians and the Achamenid Persians.
Alexander the Great took over the city in 333 BC.
Seleucus Nicator established a Hellenic settlement in the site between 301-286 BC.
He called it "Beroea" (Βέροια), after Beroea in Macedon.
Northern Syria was the centre of gravity of the Hellenistic colonizing activity, and therefore of Hellenistic culture in the Seleucid Empire.
As did other Hellenized cities of the Seleucid kingdom, Beroea probably enjoyed a measure of local autonomy, with a local civic assembly or "boulē" composed of free Hellenes.
Beroea remained under Seleucid rule for nearly 300 years until the last holdings of the Seleucid dynasty were handed over to Pompey in 64 BC, at which time they became a Roman province.
Rome's presence afforded relative stability in northern Syria for over three centuries.
Although the province was administered by a legate from Rome, Rome did not impose its administrative organization on the Greek-speaking ruling class.
Beroea is mentioned in 2 Macc. 13:3.
The Sassanid Persians invaded Syria briefely in the early 7th century.
Soon after Aleppo fell to Arabs under Khalid ibn al-Walid in 637.
In 944, it became the seat of an independent Emirate under the Hamdanid prince Sayf al-Daula, and enjoyed a period of great prosperity.
On 9 August 1138, a deadly earthquake ravaged the city and the surrounding area.
Although estimates from this time are very unreliable, it is believed that 230,000 people died, making it the fifth deadliest earthquake in recorded history.
After Tamerlane invaded Aleppo in 1400 and destroyed it, the Christians migrated out of the city walls and established their own cell in 1420, at the northwestern suburbs of the city, thus founding the quarters of Jdeydeh.
The inhabitants of Jdeydeh were mainly brokers who facilitated trade between foreign traders and local merchants.
Many other districts were built outside the historic walls during the 15th and 16th centuries.
Mention is made of the city, by one of the witches, in William Shakespeare's Macbeth, written between 1603 and 1607.
Aleppo is characterized by mixed architectural styles, having been ruled, among the other, by Romans, Byzantines, Seljuqs, Mamluks and Ottomans.
Various types of 13th and 14th centuries constructions, such as caravanserais, caeserias, Quranic schools, hammams and religious buildings are found in the old city.
The quarters of Jdeydeh district are home to numerous 16th and 17th-century houses of the Aleppine bourgeoisie, featuring stone engravings.
The city's strategic trading position attracted settlers of all races and beliefs who wished to take advantage of the commercial roads that met in Aleppo from as far as China and Mesopotamia to the east, Europe to the west, and the Fertile Crescent and Egypt to the south.
The largest covered souq-market in the world is in Aleppo, with an approximate length of . "Al-Madina Souq", as it is locally known, is an active trade centre for imported luxury goods, such as raw silk from Iran, spices and dyes from India, and coffee from Damascus.
Souq al-Madina is also home to local products such as wool, agricultural products and soap.
Most of the souqs date back to the 14th century and are named after various professions and crafts, hence the wool souq, the copper souq, and so on.
Aside from trading, the souq accommodated the traders and their goods in "khans" (caravanserais) and scattered in the souq.
Other types of small market-places were called "caeserias" (قيساريات).
Caeserias are smaller than khans in their sizes and functioned as workshops for craftsmen.
Most of the khans took their names after their location in the souq and function, and are characterized with their beautiful façades and entrances with fortified wooden doors.
The most significant khans within and along the covered area of Souq al-Madina are: "Khan al-Qadi" from 1450, "Khan al-Saboun" from the early 16th century, "Khan al-Nahhaseen" from 1539, "Khan al-Shouneh" from 1546, "Khan al-Jumrok" from 1574, "Souq Khan al-Wazir" from 1682, "Souq al-Farrayin", "Souq al-Dira"', "Souq al-Hiraj", "Souq al-Attarine", "Souq az-Zirb", "Souq Marcopoli", "Souq as-Siyyagh", "The Venetians' Khan",*"Souq Khan al-Harir" from the second half of the 16th century, "Suweiqa", etc.
Other traditional souqs and khans in Jdeydeh quarter (outside the walled city): The most significant historic buildings of the ancient city include: The most significant historic buildings of Jdeydeh Christian quarter include: The old part of the city is surrounded with thick walls, pierced by the nine historical gates (many of them are well-preserved) of the old town.
These are, clockwise from the north-east of the citadel: Aleppo was home to 177 hammams during the medieval period, until the Mongol invasion when many vital structures in the city were destroyed.
Nowadays, roughly 18 hammams are operating in the old city.
Old quarters around the citadel inside the walls of the ancient city: Old quarters outside the walls of the ancient city: As an ancient trading centre, Aleppo's impressive "souqs", "khans", "hammams", "madrasas", mosques and churches are all in need of more care and preservation work.
After World War II, the city was significantly redesigned; in 1954 French architect André Gutton had a number of wide new roads cut through the city to allow easier passage for modern traffic.
Between 1954-1983 many buildings in the old city were demolished to allow for the construction of modern apartment blocks, particularly in the northwestern areas (Bab al-Faraj and Bab al-Jinan).
As awareness for the need to preserve this unique cultural heritage increased, Gutton's master plan was finally abandoned in 1979 to be replaced with a new plan presented by the Swiss expert and urban designer Stefano Bianca, which adopted the idea of "preserving the traditional architectural style of Ancient Aleppo" paving the way for prominent local activists, among them Adli Qudsi, to convince UNESCO to declare the Ancient City of Aleppo as a World Heritage Site in 1986.
Several international institutions joined efforts with local authorities and the Aleppo Archaeological Society, to rehabilitate the old city by accommodating contemporary life while preserving the old one.
The governorate and the municipality were implementing serious programmes directed towards the enhancement of the ancient city and Jdeydeh quarter.
The German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and Aga Khan Foundation (within the frames of Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme) had a great contribution in the preservation process of the old city.
The local representative of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture from 1999 until 2008 was the architect Adli Qudsi, who played a large role in the protection of the Old City form the destructive forces of urban expansion.

Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams (known in-film as Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams) is a 2002 American spy adventure comedy film produced, written, shot, edited and directed by Robert Rodriguez, co-produced by Elizabeth Avellán and starring Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Alexa Vega, Daryl Sabara, Mike Judge, Ricardo Montalbán, Holland Taylor, Christopher McDonald, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Steve Buscemi, Taylor Momsen, Matt O'Leary, and Emily Osment.
The second installment in the "Spy Kids" film series, which began with 2001's "Spy Kids", the film had its world premiere screening on July 28, 2002 at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California.
Shortly after that, the film was theatrically released on August 7, 2002 by Dimension Films.
Upon release, "Spy Kids 2" received mostly positive reviews from critics and grossed over $119 million worldwide.
The OSS now has a full child spy section, of which 13-year-old Carmen Cortez and 10-year-old Juni Cortez have become agents.
Even though they were the first of the new Spy Kids Division, they were not considered the top spy kids, and soon they face particularly difficult competition from Gary and Gerti Giggles, the children of double-dealing agent Donnagon Giggles, whom Carmen and Juni helped to rescue in the previous film.
It is shown that Carmen defends Gary, and has a crush on him, which strains her relationship with Juni.
At a gala event, Donnagon somehow hacks into the teleprompter which the President was reading from, and is named director of the OSS.
A fight ensues when a group of Magna Men arrive and render all adults unconscious.
They are after the "Transmooker", a highly coveted device which can shut off all electronic devices.
Juni recovers it, but drops it when Gary tries to take it from him.
Gary then frames Juni for the loss, resulting in Juni being fired.
In his new position as director, Donnagon can carry on with his plan to steal the Transmooker, so he can rule the world.
The next morning Carmen hacks into the database and reinstates Juni as an agent.
They take a mission meant for Gary and Gerti to recover the Transmooker.
She and Juni use some hints from Alexander Minion, and follow the trail to a mysterious island where all electronics refuse to work.
Shortly after arriving they meet Romero, a lunatic scientist.
Romero has been attempting to create genetically-miniaturized animals, so he can make a profit by selling the animals to kids in "miniature zoos."
He had an experiment go wrong after accidentally pouring growth concoction onto the mutated set of animals.
As a result, he is unwilling to leave his lab, out of fear of being eaten.
When Carmen is captured by a Spork, a breed of flying pig, she is dropped into its nest with Gerti, who reveals to her that Gary is genuinely evil.
Carmen changes her feelings for Gary after he tries to kill Juni, and she sides with her brother.
Romero, having been encouraged by Juni, finds out that his creatures are much friendlier than he thought.
Carmen and Juni eventually find and recover the Transmooker, and are surprised when they are joined by their family, who were informed of their disappearance.
The group is then confronted by Donnagon, who takes the Transmooker and attempts to use it to destroy the Cortez family, but it malfunctions.
Gerti reveals she sabotaged it and threatens Donnagon with telling everything to her mother.
The President and his staff arrive on the island.
Donnagon is fired by the President and his daughter, Alexandra; Gary is temporarily disavowed, and Gregorio is appointed director of the OSS by Alexandra on her father's behalf.
Even though he is offered a promotion, Juni resigns due to the impersonal treatment he had received by the OSS after being framed.
As the Cortez family leaves the island, Romero gives Juni a miniature spider-monkey as a gift, and all the island's inhabitants bid farewell to the Cortez family.
During the credits, Machete has Carmen sing as an undercover pop star in a concert.
Carmen says she cannot sing so Machete gives her a microphone which auto-tunes her voice, and a belt that helps her dance.
He also gives Juni a guitar that plays itself.
After a successful performance, Carmen and Juni return to a shocked Machete, who discovered that he never put batteries on the device.
Carmen is shocked to find out she can, in fact, sing without auto-tune.
As the credits come to a close, Dinky Winks paddles to Romero's island to strike up a business deal.
Spy Kids 2 was filmed entirely on High Definition digital video.
After seeing George Lucas using digital video for Rodriguez tested the technology during reshoots for the first Spy Kids film.
Rodriguez used the cameras unfiltered.
Despite the fact that this film uses over twice the amount of special effects shots than the first film, Rodriguez did not ask the producers for a larger budget; he said "...I told the studio I don't want more money.
I just want to be more creative".
Rodriguez picked some visual effects companies who were eager and less established, as well as starting up his own Troublemaker Studios, and reemploying Hybride, who had worked with him on the first film.
Gregor Punchatz, the film's lead animator, employed a certain technique to make the movements of the computer generated creatures resemble the stop-motion work of filmmaker Ray Harryhausen, who has a cameo in the film.
The scene with the army of live skeletons was shot on a real rock formation, with the two young actors on safety wires, and the computer generated skeletons added later to over three dozen shots. "Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams" opened theatrically on August 7, 2002 in 3,307 venues and earned $16,711,716 in its first weekend, ranking third in the North American box office behind "XXX" and the second weekend of "Signs".
The film ended its run on January 12, 2003, having grossed $85,846,429 in the United States and Canada, and $33,876,929 overseas for a worldwide total of $119,723,358.
The film received mostly positive reviews from critics.
On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 75% "Certified Fresh" approval score based on 134 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10.
The site's critical consensus reads: "Though the concept is no longer fresh, "Spy Kids 2" is still an agreeable and energetic romp."
Metacritic reports a 66 out of 100 rating based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and commented, "With ""Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams"," the "Spy Kids" franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape: a James Bond series for kids.
Kenneth Turan of the "New York Times " gave it 4 out of 5 stars said, "The movie is a gaudy, noisy thrill ride -- hyperactive, slightly out of control and full of kinetic, mischievous charm."
Lisa Schwarzbaum of "Entertainment Weekly" wrote, "The antics are a tad more frantic, and the gizmos work overtime, as if ... Robert Rodriguez felt the hot breath of el diablo on his neck.
On the other hand, the inventiveness is still superior and the network of and family is extended."
Michael Wilmington of Metromix Chicago, noting how Rodriguez borrows many elements from television and earlier films, stated that, "Rodriguez recycles and refurbishes all these old movie bits with the opportunistic energy of a man looting his old attic toy chest -- but he also puts some personal feeling into the movie.
This is a film about families staying together, children asserting themselves and even, to some degree, Latino power".
The film was released on VHS and DVD in the United States on February 18, 2003.
The film is also available to download on iTunes.
A Blu-ray re-release was scheduled for August 2, 2011 to coincide with the fourth film.
The film score was co-written by director Robert Rodriguez and composer John Debney, who had also co-written the score for "Spy Kids".
The sound is a mix of rock, pop, and indie rock, and includes songs performed by Alan Cumming and Alexa Vega.
Unusually, the orchestral score was recorded in the auditorium of a local high school in Austin, Georgetown High School.
All tracks composed by Debney and Rodriguez, and performed by the Texas Philharmonic Orchestra.
Additional music not on the soundtrack album includes "Oye Como Spy", which is an adaptation of Tito Puente's "Oye Como Va", performed by Los Lobos (the song is on the soundtrack album from the first "Spy Kids" film).
"Close My Eyes" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey for her sixth studio album "Butterfly" (1997).
It was co-written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff.
While Carey solely wrote the lyrics to the song, both she and Afanasieff composed its music.
They also produced and arranged the song together.
A downtempo piano led song, the lyrics in "Close My Eyes" revolve around negative experiences in her life, including indirectly talking about the relationship between her and ex-husband Tommy Mottola.
In September 2012, Carey revealed that it is one of her most favorite and revealing songs that she has written in her career thus far.
Carey began working on "Butterfly" in January 1997.
During the album's development in mid-1997 Carey separated from her husband, music executive Tommy Mottola, who had guided her career since 1988.
Carey's increasing control over her own career had led to speculation in the press over the future of the couple, and they later divorced.
Throughout the development of the album, in a departure from her previous style, Carey worked with various rappers and hip-hop producers, including Sean "Puffy" Combs, Kamaal Fareed, Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters.
Critics saw Carey's new production team as a form of revenge on Mottola and Sony Music.
Carey denied taking a radically new direction, and insisted that the musical style of her new album was of her own choosing.
Nevertheless, Carey resented the control that Sony, whose president was Mottola, exercised over her music, preventing her making music about which she was passionate.
In contrast, Sony were concerned Carey, their best-selling act, could jeopardize her future success through her actions.
The pressure of the separation and constant press attention began to take its toll of Carey.
Growing creative differences with producer Walter Afanasieff ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's previous output.
The breaking point came after a heated argument during a long recording session, over the album's musical direction.
Carey also faced media criticism over her choice of producers and several newspapers linked Carey romantically to several rappers, suggesting these relationships influenced her decisions.
However, Carey denied the allegations, stating she had only slept with her husband. "Close My Eyes" was co-written by Carey and Walter Afanasieff; Carey solely wrote the lyrics, while both she and Afanasieff composed the musical structure.
It was also produced and arranged by Carey and Afanasieff.
The keyboards, synthesizers and programming were performed by Afanasieff.
Additional keys, drum and rhythm programming, sound design and computer programming were carried out by Dan Shea.
Dana Jon Chappelle and Mike Scott served as the engineers, while Ian Dalsemer was enlisted as the assistant engineer. "Close My Eyes" was recorded at Crave Studios and The Hit Factory, both situated in New York City.
It was mixed by Mick Gazauski at both Crave Studios and The Hit Factory.
It was mastered by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering in Portland, ME. "Close My Eyes" is a downtempo piano led song, which runs for a duration of four minutes and 19 seconds.
The lyrical content of the song speaks indirectly about Carey's relationship with Mottola, and reflects on times in her life where she has had personal struggles and troubles.
Her past is presented in the lyrics "I was a wayward child, with the weight of the world that I held deep inside" and "Life was a winding road, and I learned many things little ones shouldn't know."
As described by David Browne for "Entertainment Weekly", Carey "paints herself" in the lyrics as "A wayward child, with the weight of the world".
He also noted that the singer seems concerned that she had to grow up quicker than was perhaps necessary, in order to live her life in a controlled environment, "Maybe I grew up a little too soon."
During the chorus, Carey lightens the mood of the song by singing about having courage to face times of adversity, "But I closed my eyes, steadied my feet on the ground, raised my head to the sky.
And though times rolled by, still I feel like a child as I look at the moon.
Maybe I grew up a little too soon."
Jon Pareles for "The New York Times" wrote that Carey "coos" the lyrics "Maybe I grew up a little too soon" and "That woman-child inside was on the verge of fading/ Thankfully I woke up in time."
David Browne for "Entertainment Weekly" described how "Close My Eyes", as well as another track from the album entitled "Butterfly", were not difficult songs to interpret, writing "It isn't a reach to interpret these songs as describing life with the reportedly controlling Mottola."
Jon Pareles for "The New York Times" wrote that with regard to the lyrics "Maybe I grew up a little too soon" and "That woman-child inside was on the verge of fading/ Thankfully I woke up in time," "Carey isn't about to turn into Alanis Morissette; "Butterfly" proclaims dependence more humbly than ever."
In their guide to Carey's albums, "Rolling Stone" stated that "Close My Eyes," along with "Butterfly" and "Breakdown," were songs which indirectly spoke about her "pending extraction from the tentacles" of Mottola, who exercised his power over her as the head of Sony, the label to which Carey was signed.
Carey performed "Close My Eyes" for the first time live on "The Rosie O'Donnell Show" in 1997.
The performance saw Carey perform the song sitting on a stool, wearing a white vest top and jeans.
It was also included on the set list of her Butterfly World Tour of 1998 and Rainbow World Tour of 2000.
In an interview with CNN on September 7, 2012, where she was honored by Broadcast Music, Inc. for her songwriting, Carey declared "Close My Eyes" as one of her favorite and most revealing songs that she has written.
She stated that it is not always her number one or signature songs which are her favorite, rather, they are "lesser-known cuts from more obscure records."
When asked about how she felt about some of her number-one singles, including "Hero" ("Music Box", 1993), "We Belong Together" ("The Emancipation of Mimi", 2005) and "Touch My Body" ("E=MC²", 2008), the singer revealed "I still love those songs, [but] I love the obscure songs because they're very close to my heart.
Especially a song called 'Close My Eyes,' that's like my life story."
In addition to "Close My Eyes," Carey cited "Looking In," "I Am Free," and "Underneath the Stars" ("Daydream", 1995) as some of her favorites.
The song is included on the U.S. release of "The Essential Mariah Carey".
On Carey's official Facebook page on May 12, 2012, shortly after the release, she wrote, "I spent four years writing this song, only because after I performed in Schenectady, NY, I started hearing this melody and singing it over and over to myself as I was taking a bath, looking at the moon.. Four years later, as I was leaving a devastating part of my life behind, I wrote the second verse, the bridge and the outro."

Hog Cliff is a national nature reserve (NNR) and Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) located south east of Maiden Newton, Dorset and north-west of Dorchester.
It was notified as an SSSI in 1981.
The site is also part of the much larger Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).
It is adjacent to the Court Farm, Sydling SSSI.
The area of the site is .
It is a chalk downland and thus part of the Dorset Downs.
The site includes grassland, scrub and a small amount of woodland (mostly ash and oak, with a hazel and field maple understory); within the grassland there is a difference in character, and the species that it supports, which varies according to the gradient and aspect of the slopes.
While the invertebrates on the site have not been extensively studied, it is known that species such as the rare Adonis blue and marsh fritillary butterflies can be found there; this is in addition to more common species such as the green hairstreak, common blue and gatekeeper.
Fungi, particularly grassland varieties, are very well represented at Hog Cliff; the SSSI citation indicates over 60 genera as having been identified, whilst Natural England claim 100 species for the NNR.
Cattle and sheep graze the site throughout the year to keep the grassland open.
In 2008, a case was brought by the Environment Agency against a nearby pig farmer who was deliberately allowing pig slurry to be discharged onto land that included part of the Hog Cliff reserve.
Grevillea aurea, commonly known as the Golden grevillea or the Deaf Adder Gorge grevillea, is a shrub native to the Northern Territory in Australia.
The tall and open shrub typically grows to a height of with blue-green oblong dentate leaves that are long with 4 to 12 toothed lobes per side.
It blooms from April to August and produces coppery buds followed by orange yellow flowers. "Grevillea aurea" has a limited range and is confined to parts of the Kakadu National Park where it is found on escarpments and sandstone ridges.

Panelefsiniakos B.C. (Greek: Πανελευσινιακός K.A.E.)
is a Greek professional basketball club that is located in Eleusis, Athens, Greece.
Panelefsiniakos basketball section was founded in 1969, and the club is also commonly known as Elefsina B.C.
The team competes in the Greek B Basket League since 2015.
The club's parent athletic association, Panelefsiniakos A.O.K.
Eleusina, was founded in the year 1931.
The club's basketball section, Panelefsiniakos B.C., was founded in the year 1969.
Panelefsiniakos B.C. won the Greek Second Division championship in 2012.
The club competed in the first tier professional basketball league in Greece (Greek Basket League) for first time in its history in the 2012–13 season.
Panelefsiniakos made a mediocre start at its debut Greek Basket League season, as the team registered just 2 victories in the first 10 match days of the league.
The team spent the first round playing at Peristeri Arena (17 km away from the town of Eleusis), due to necessary renovation to its home court which lasted for about 3 months.
In order to avoid relegation, Panelefsiniakos improved its performance in the following months and got crucial wins at home against PAOK, Panionios and Peristeri.
The team of coach Giorgos Skarafigkas beat also KAOD and Rethymno and finished the season with a 7–19 record (11th spot in the standings).
Greek combo guard Nikos Liakopoulos was team's season MVP with 15.3 points per game on average and generally had great contribution.
After the end of a successful season, Panelefsiniakos made a lot of important changes to its roster in summer of 2013, including the addition of Olympiacos former captain and Greek NT member Manolis Papamakarios.
The blue-whites begun strongly the 2013–14 season with 3 victories in the first 5 games, one of them on the road against Ikaros at Chalkida.
Two match days before regular season's end, Panelefsiniakos, led by swingman David Kyles who scored 20 points and grabbed 4 rebounds, crushed Trikala at home and made a decisive step in order to stay at the top division.
Finally, the goal was achieved as the club, despite its ups and downs during the year, once again managed to avoid relegation.
Coach Skarafigkas' players celebrated 7 wins, in a season where center Larry Turner (9.2 points and 3.2 rebounds per game) and power forward Mouhammad Faye (13.5 points and 7.6 rebounds per game) were solid.
Panelefsiniakos plays its home games at the Elefsina Indoor Hall (also known as "Gouva"), which has a seating capacity of 1,100 people.
The club used Peristeri Indoor Hall for some months in the beginning of the 2012–13 season, due to renovation to its traditional home court.
Smithville is a community in the township of West Lincoln.
The former police village is located on Highway 20 between Hamilton and Niagara Falls in the Niagara Region of Ontario, Canada.
Smithville is the largest population centre and governing centre of the township of West Lincoln.
Smithville was first settled by Richard Griffin and his family, United Empire Loyalists who came from Nine Partners, New York in 1787.
The names of his sons were Abraham, Edward, Nathaniel, Isaiah, Smith, Jonathan, and Richard Jr.
They settled on Lots 8, 9, 10, Concession IX, on the Twenty Mile Creek in Grimsby (later South Grimsby) Township.
Solomon Hill, who married Bethia, daughter of Richard Griffin, settled on Lot 6, Charles Meridith on Lot 7; Thomas Harris on Lot 11, and Thomas North on Lot 12.
These lots, all in the 9th Concession became the settlement first known as Griffintown, but later renamed after Mrs. Griffin, whose maiden name was Mary Smith.
Edward "Ned" Griffin is sometimes claimed to be the real founder of the village.
He was the one who felled the first tree, chose the village site, cleared the first acre of land, built the first house, and lived his entire life in the village.
Another son, Smith Griffin, is credited with building a treadwheel in 1810.
Settlers who wanted their grain ground were required to provide their own motive power by putting their oxen on the tread.
Later, Smith Griffin built a dam and mill on the Twenty Mile Creek, making the treadmill obsolete.
Smith also started an ashery, while his brother Edward opened a general store.
By 1849, Smithville had reached a population of about 150, and had been granted a post office with twice-weekly delivery.
The settlement had a grist mill, a saw mill, a carding machine and cloth factory, four stores, one machine shop, one tannery, two blacksmiths, two tailors and two shoemakers.
Smithville first became a police village in 1887, however the arrangement was unsatisfactory and the village again became part of South Grimsby Township in 1889.
It was not until 1914 that Smithville was reorganized into a police village on a more permanent basis.
By the 1950s, the population had grown to approximately 1000 souls Smithville, along with the remainder of South Grimsby Township was amalgamated into the newly formed Township of West Lincoln on January 1, 1970.
Smithville was known for an annual festival called PoultryFest .
The festival was held annually on the third Saturday in June, and residents from various areas of the region visiex to see the town's display of agricultural pride.
PoultryFest ended in 2017.
The West Niagara Agricultural Society holds an agricultural fair before Labour Day every year at the West Niagara Fairgrounds at the corner of Grimsby Road and Mud Street, approximately five kilometres from town.
The Smithville Fair was formerly held at the West Lincoln Mixed Use Recreation Site, formerly the Smithville Fairgrounds.
The merger of Smithville Agricultural Society and with the Lincoln Agricultural Society in 2012 prompted the move to the new, larger grounds in 2015.
There are lots of agricultural competitions, demolition derbies and entertainment for all ages.
Retail establishments in Smithville are congregated amongst two major nodes: the downtown core, and the Village Square Mall.
Smithville got it first and only tattoo establishment called Hellbender Ink Vintage Tattoo.
It opened in 2013, and is a well respected business known for its various charity endeavours and community support.
Smithville has five schools, including four elementary and one secondary.
Smithville Public School, on Colver Street, opened in 2018 in the former South Lincoln High School.
Coincidentally, the now disused College Street Public School had been the location of Smithville High School until 1948.
St. Martin's, on West Street (Highway 20) is a elementary school in the Catholic (separate) board.
John Calvin (Station Street) and Covenant Christian (Townline Road) are private Christian schools, associated with the Canadian Reformed Church and the Christian Reformed Church in North America, respectively.
Smithville Christian High School, formerly Smithville District Christian High School, is a Christian secondary school and the only remaining secondary school in town, after the closure of South Lincoln High School for the 2017-2018 school year, which ended over 150 years of public secondary education in the community.
In some ways Smithville acts as the "administrative centre" of the Township of West Lincoln.
The council chambers and the largest branch of the municipal library are located in town, as well as the major fire station.
The public works yard is also centralized in a Smithville location.
From 1970 to 2018, Smithville fell just north of the boundary of two municipal wards.
The area north of Townline Road, the bulk of the community, was part of Ward 3, the former Township of South Grimsby.
New development south of Townline, mainly the Alma Acres, fell into Ward 2, the former Township of Gainsborough.
In 2018, a revision of ward boundaries placed Smithville and its environs into a new, smaller Ward 3.
West Lincoln elects one regional councilor, in addition to the Mayor who also serves as the local regional council.
Federally and provincially, Smithville is located in the riding of Niagara West.
Population: Mother tongue: Patron: Parks in Smithville include the Smithville Conservation Area, and the Mixed Use Recreational Site (MURS).
The "Murgatroyd Parkette" is at the corner of Griffin and St. Catharines Street.
It has trees and benches, and features the town clock (from the original post offices) mounted on a pedestal.
The Smithville Branch of the West Lincoln Public Library is located on Canborough St. and open six days a week.
The Kiwanis of West Lincoln was chartered in May 2018 and currently meets at the Smithville legion on alternating Tuesday’s Two Regional Roads run through Smithville.
Regional Road 20, formerly King's Highway 20, goes primarily east-west, along St. Catharines Street, Griffin Street North and West Street.
Highway 20 continues to be the major artery in Smithville, and West Lincoln as a whole, connecting Smithville to Hamilton and Niagara Falls.
Regional Road 14 enters Smithville from the west along Townline Road.
The designation continues north along Canborough Street and Griffin Street South. 14 and 20 form a brief concurrency along Griffin Street North.
14 continues along Station Street and continues north of town as Thirty Road.
To the south, Regional Road 14, continuing as Haldimand County Road 14, connects Smithville to Highway 3 at Canborough.
To the north, the 14 designation ends at Mud Street north of town.
Major roads in town include: Canborough Street Griffin Street St. Catharines Street South Grimsby Road 7 Station Street Townline Road West Street Smithville is located he Canadian Pacific's Hamilton Subdivision, the mainline of the former-Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway.
Smithville had a passenger station until 1981, when all such service along the line was discontinued.
The former station (built 1903) is a local landmark, and serves as the headquarters of the West Lincoln Historical Society.
Smithville was also the junction with the railroad's Dunnville spur.
Passenger service along the Dunnville line was suspended in 1933.
Freight service lasted until 2003, when the line was abandoned.
The tracks were subsequently lifted and the bridges over the Twenty Mile Creek and Highway 20 demolished.
Mast/stem cell growth factor receptor (SCFR), also known as proto-oncogene c-Kit or tyrosine-protein kinase Kit or CD117, is a receptor tyrosine kinase protein that in humans is encoded by the KIT gene.
Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
KIT was first described by the German biochemist Axel Ullrich in 1987 as the cellular homolog of the feline sarcoma viral oncogene v-kit.
Cluster of differentiation (CD) molecules are markers on the cell surface, as recognized by specific sets of antibodies, used to identify the cell type, stage of differentiation and activity of a cell.
CD117 is an important cell surface marker used to identify certain types of hematopoietic (blood) progenitors in the bone marrow.
To be specific, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), multipotent progenitors (MPP), and common myeloid progenitors (CMP) express high levels of CD117.
Common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) express low surface levels of CD117.
CD117 also identifies the earliest thymocyte progenitors in the thymus.
To be specific, early T lineage progenitors (ETP/DN1) and DN2 thymocytes express high levels of c-Kit.
It is also a marker for mouse prostate stem cells.
In addition, mast cells, melanocytes in the skin, and interstitial cells of Cajal in the digestive tract express CD117.
In humans, expression of c-kit in helper-like innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) which lack the expression of CRTH2 (CD294) is used to mark the ILC3 population.
CD117 is a cytokine receptor expressed on the surface of hematopoietic stem cells as well as other cell types.
Altered forms of this receptor may be associated with some types of cancer.
CD117 is a receptor tyrosine kinase type III, which binds to stem cell factor (a substance that causes certain types of cells to grow), also known as "steel factor" or "c-kit ligand".
When this receptor binds to stem cell factor (SCF) it forms a dimer that activates its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, that in turn phosphorylates and activates signal transduction molecules that propagate the signal in the cell.
Signaling through CD117 plays a role in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation.
Hematopoietic progenitor cells are normally present in the blood at low levels.
Mobilization is the process by which progenitors are made to migrate from the bone marrow into the bloodstream, thus increasing their numbers in the blood.
Mobilization is used clinically as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
Signaling through CD117 has been implicated in mobilization.
At the current time, G-CSF is the main drug used for mobilization; it indirectly activates CD117.
Plerixafor (an antagonist of CXCR4-SDF1) in combination with G-CSF, is also being used for mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells.
Direct CD117 agonists are currently being developed as mobilization agents.
Activating mutations in this gene are associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors, testicular seminoma, mast cell disease, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, while inactivating mutations are associated with the genetic defect piebaldism.
CD117 is a proto-oncogene, meaning that overexpression or mutations of this protein can lead to cancer.
Seminomas, a subtype of testicular germ cell tumors, frequently have activating mutations in exon 17 of CD117.
In addition, the gene encoding CD117 is frequently overexpressed and amplified in this tumor type, most commonly occurring as a single gene amplicon.
Mutations of CD117 have also been implicated in leukemia, a cancer of hematopoietic progenitors, melanoma, mast cell disease, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).
The efficacy of imatinib (trade name Gleevec), a CD117 inhibitor, is determined by the mutation status of CD117: When the mutation has occurred in exon 11 (as is the case many times in GISTs), the tumors are responsive to imatinib.
However, if the mutation occurs in exon 17 (as is often the case in seminomas and leukemias), the receptor is not inhibited by imatinib.
In those cases other inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib can be used.
Researchers investigated the dynamic behavior of wild type and mutant D816H KIT receptor, and emphasized the extended A-loop (EAL) region (805-850) by conducting computational analysis.
Their atomic investigation of mutant KIT receptor which emphasized on the EAL region provided a better insight into the understanding of the sunitinib resistance mechanism of the KIT receptor and could help to discover new therapeutics for KIT-based resistant tumor cells in GIST therapy.
The preclinical agent, KTN0182A, is an anti-KIT, pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD)-containing antibody-drug conjugate which shows anti-tumor activity "in vitro" and "in vivo" against a range of tumor types.
Antibodies to CD117 are widely used in immunohistochemistry to help distinguish particular types of tumour in histological tissue sections.
It is used primarily in the diagnosis of GISTs, which are positive for CD117, but negative for markers such as desmin and S-100, which are positive in smooth muscle and neural tumors, which have a similar appearance.
In GISTs, CD117 staining is typically cytoplasmic, with stronger accentuation along the cell membranes.
CD117 antibodies can also be used in the diagnosis of mast cell tumours and in distinguishing seminomas from embryonal carcinomas.
CD117 has been shown to interact with:
"Ticklish Reuben" is a folk song written by Cal Stewart in 1900.
Released on the Victor Label, the song is a prime example of the "laughing song" genre.
Initially, the tune starts off normally, then descends into jolly, rhythmic laughing. "Oh",
Oregon Route 244 (OR 244) is an Oregon state highway running from Ukiah in Umatilla County to Hilgard in Union County.
OR 244 is known as the Ukiah-Hilgard Highway No. 341 (see Oregon highways and routes).
It is long and runs east–west.
OR 244 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 395 west of Ukiah and continues east and northeast to Hilgard, where it ends at an intersection with Interstate 84.
This is the 2nd Oregon Route to use the number 244.
The first OR 244 was located in suburban Portland, connecting U.S. 99W near Tualatin with OR 43 in West Linn.
That route later became part of an extended Oregon Route 212, but was deleted from the state highway system after Interstate 205 was completed.
Thung Chang is a district ("amphoe") in the northern part of Nan Province, northern Thailand.
Thung Chang District dates back to the "Khwaeng" Khun Nan (ขุนน่าน), which was converted into the district Lae (และ) in 1914.
In 1961 it was renamed Thung Chang, as the district office had been moved to "tambon" Thung Chang.
Neighboring districts are, from the east clockwise, Chaloem Phra Kiat, Pua, Chiang Klang and Song Khwae of Nan Province.
To the north is Xaignabouli of Laos.
The eastern part of the district is in the Luang Prabang Range of the Thai highlands.
Thung Chang is divided into four sub-districts ("tambons"), which are further subdivided into 40 administrative villages ("mubans").
There are two sub-district municipalities ("thesaban tambons") in the district: There are three sub-district administrative organizations (SAO) in the district:
netgraph is the graph based kernel networking subsystem of FreeBSD.
Netgraph provides support for L2TP, PPTP, ATM, bluetooth using a modular set of nodes that are the graph.
Netgraph has also been ported on other Operating Systems: Netgraph was originally designed and implemented at Whistle Communications by Julian Elischer and Archie Cobbs for the Whistle InterJet small office router product.
The purpose of the project was to create a flexible framework for implementing new networking protocols.
Key requirements included the ability to prototype with user-space programs while still retaining the ability to interact with data flows normally hidden within the kernel.
Postumus is a Latin praenomen, or personal name, which was most common during the early centuries of the Roman Republic.
It gave rise to the patronymic "gens Postumia", and later became a common cognomen, or surname.
The feminine form is "Postuma".
The name was not regularly abbreviated, but is sometimes found as Pos. or Post.
Postumus was used by both patrician and plebeian gentes, including the Aebutii, Antistii, Cominii, Livii, Mimesii, Plautii, Sempronii, Sulpicii, and Veturii; and naturally it must once have been used by the ancestors of gens Postumia.
Other "gentes" which later used it as a cognomen may originally have used it as a praenomen.
Because it was not a common name, there are few examples of the feminine form, but Marcus Terentius Varro listed it together with other archaic praenomina that were no longer in general use by the 1st century BC, and Plutarchus mentions that it was given to the youngest daughter of the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who lived during Varro's time.
Popular etymology connects this praenomen with the modern adjective "posthumous", meaning "after death", from the Latin roots for "after" and "earth" (as a metaphor for burial), and assume that it was given to children born after the death of their fathers.
Such associations date from at least the time of Varro, and probably contributed to the scarcity of the name.
A similar example of false etymology probably limited the use of the praenomen "Opiter".
In fact, the name is derived from the adjective "", meaning "last" (the superlative of "posterus", "next").
The name was thus given to a youngest child, son, or daughter.
Naturally, this also applied to children born after the death of their father, and this coincidence is no doubt responsible for much of the confusion about the meaning of the praenomen.

Old West Church is a historic church on Old West Road in the Kents Corner area of Calais, Vermont.
Built 1823-25, it is a little-altered example of an early 19th-century rural Vermont church.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.
The Old West Church stands in a rural area of Calais, south of the crossroads village of Kents Corner, on the west side of Old West Road.
It is a tall single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and stone foundation.
A three-stage tower rises above the front facade, with a square first stage housing the belfry, and two octagonal stages of decreasing size.
The main facade has a bank of three similar entrances, each flanked by pilasters, and all set under a common entablature and cornice.
Sash windows flank this assemblage, and a second level also has three sash windows.
The interior has a vestibule with stairs leading to a gallery level on either side, and is otherwise a single large chamber.
The gallery extends on three sides, supported by square posts.
The pulpit is against the far wall, and the interior is filled with original plain pine box pews.
The church was built in the mid-1820s, in a style that was more common to the late 18th century.
The pulpit, originally built at the height of the gallery, was lowered to its present height a few years later.
The building has no modern amenities, and is heated by wood stoves installed at the rear in 1831.
Its steeple was damaged by lightning in 1953, at which time the weathervane was replaced.
The Apertura 2009 Liguilla Final is a two-legged football match-up to determine the Apertura 2009 champion.
Like other match-ups in the knockout round, the teams will play two games, one at each team's home stadium.
As the highest seeded team determined at the beginning of the Liguilla, Irapuato was to have home-field advantage for the second leg.
If the teams remained tied after 90 minutes of play during the 2nd leg, extra time will be used, followed by a penalty shootout if necessary.

Money in the Pocket is a live album by jazz saxophonist Cannonball Adderley featuring performances by Adderley with Nat Adderley, Joe Zawinul, Herbie Lewis and Roy McCurdy.
Recorded at The Club in Chicago in 1966, it was not released on the Capitol label until 2005.
However, edited versions of four of the songs were released as singles in 1966: "Money in the Pocket"/"Hear Me Talking to You" on Capitol 5648, and "Sticks"/"Cannon's Theme" on Capitol 5736.
The Allmusic review by Al Campbell awarded the album 4 stars and states "Cannonball Adderley's mega-successful album "Mercy, Mercy, Mercy! ", released in August of 1966, was supposedly recorded "live" at a venue in Chicago called The Club, but it was actually recorded in the studio of Capitol Records with a specially assembled audience.
For those who wonder what they really sounded like at that venue, "Money in the Pocket" contains unreleased live recordings of the Cannonball Adderley Quintet at The Club in Chicago... Any Cannonball Adderley fan will want to own this". "The Penguin Guide to Jazz" awarded the album 3½ stars stating "The sound is rather noisy (especially McCurdy's drums), but if anything this is a warmer set than the 'official' one from later in the year.
"Stardust" is a vintage Cannon performance, and "Fiddler on the Roof", all but takes the roof off". "All compositions by Julian "Cannonball" Adderley except as indicated"
Live Phish Vol. 10 was recorded live at the Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Columbus, Ohio on June 22, 1994.
It features the band on their 1994 summer tour.
The group plays an experimental version of "Mike's Song," interpolating an early version of the Mike Gordon staple "Simple" and a jam based on the bass line and melody of The Allman Brothers Band's "Midnight Rider," as well as a version of the rarely-played "Icculus."
Bonus tracks include two songs from the Murat Theater in Indianapolis, Indiana on June 24, 1994.
Before the second set begins with "2001", Trey Anastasio informs the audience of the current score of Game 7 of the 1994 NBA Finals ("First quarter, Houston by 5").
The game is also mentioned during the Icculus narration ("Even if you're playing in the NBA finals, and you're winning by 5 points, [...] you'd damn well better read the book! "), and once more at the very end of the show ("After the third quarter: the Knicks 60, Houston 63!
").
Carlos Alberto Ramírez Castillo (born November 6, 1976 in Mexico City) is a retired Mexican professional footballer.
He lasted played for Deportivo Irapuato, wearing #13.
He is nicknamed "Tin-Tan" because of an apparent physical likeness to the Mexican actor.

He debuted with Atlante F.C. in 2003 and played for that team until 2005, scoring 15 goals in 4 seasons.
He then came to Tigres in 2006 as part of an agreement that the team made to sign Sebastián González.
In Tigres, Carlos Ramírez became the amulet of victory, for even though he has only scored two goals in one season, those have been of incredible importance for the team.
On March 12, 2006 he scored the winning goal at the last minute of the 81st Clásico Regiomontano, and on April 19 he also scored the winning goal, again at the last minute, of the Tigres v. Universidad Católica match of the Copa Libertadores de América group stage that eliminated the Chilean team and had Tigres qualify for round of 16.

Empros is the fourth studio album by the American rock band Russian Circles.
The album was released on October 25, 2011 through Sargent House.
This is Russian Circles' first album released solely through Sargent House; for their first three albums, Sargent House released limited edition vinyl copies, while CD and digital copies were handled by either Suicide Squeeze Records or Flameshovel Records.
Russian Circles began writing "Empros" in January 2011.
In April 2011, the group entered Phantom Manor studios in Chicago, Illinois with producer Brandon Curtis of The Secret Machines and Interpol, who also previously produced the group's 2009 album "Geneva".
Bassist Brian Cook described the band's mindset for creating "Empros" as trying to "make the same ebb and flow of our live set happen on the record, with more constructive dynamics and dramatic bridging between songs."
The album was also described in a press release from Sargent House as being Russian Circles' heaviest album to date.
On September 28, 2011 the song "Mládek" was made available for online streaming and free download.
The title of the song was named after Tomáš Mládek, Russian Circles' European tour bus driver.
The album was highly acclaimed by critics at the time of its release, eventually earning an aggregated rating of 86 on Metacritic from 14 reviews.
In particular, many writers noted how refined the band's sound had become in its evolution.
In his review for Spin, critic Christopher R. Weingarten wrote, "Though crunching at their heaviest, the band still shines brightest when they edge toward indie-rock approachability."

Hurricane is a heavy metal band formed in the 1980s, originally featuring current Foreigner lead vocalist Kelly Hansen (vocals/rhythm guitar), Robert Sarzo (guitar), Tony Cavazo (bass), and Jay Schellen (drums).
Cavazo and Sarzo are the younger brothers of Quiet Riot's Carlos Cavazo and Rudy Sarzo.
Hurricane released four albums: "Take What You Want" (1985), "Over the Edge" (1988), "Slave to the Thrill" (1990), and "Liquifury" (2001). "Over the Edge" was their most successful album featuring their only charting song, "I'm on to You", which peaked at #33 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 1988.
Quiet Riot's Kevin DuBrow introduced Robert Sarzo and Tony Cavazo in the early 1980s.
After deciding to form a band, Sarzo and Cavazo recruited singer Kelly Hansen, drummer Jay Schellen and guitarist Michael Guy.
With little label interest, the band decided to release an album themselves, "Take What You Want".
The album and constant touring led to them getting a major label deal.
In 1986 & 1987 they opened for Stryper on their "To Hell with the Devil" album tour.
They were soon signed to Enigma Records, the same label as Stryper.
They also opened for Gary Moore's 87 US tour.
In 1988, the band released their major label debut album, "Over the Edge".
Propelled by a powerful, yet melodic hard rock sound, the album dipped into the top 100 (at 92) on the album charts and featured a cover of Alice Cooper's "I'm Eighteen," as well as the band's most successful song, the Jeff Jones-penned "I'm On to You."
The title track, "Over the Edge", was also released as a single.
In 1989, Sarzo left the group and was replaced by ex-Lion guitarist, Doug Aldrich.
This lineup recorded the album "Slave to the Thrill", which was released in 1990.
While Allmusic hailed the record as the band's most "focused" album, its success paled in comparison to its predecessor.
The album's relative lack of success could be attributed to changing musical climates..
Shortly after the release of this album, Aldrich moved on to House of Lords and the rest of the group quickly disintegrated with the onslaught of grunge.
In 1991 Schellen wrote, recorded and toured extensively with both Unruly Child and Sircle of Silence while Hansen did a considerable amount of session work.
Schellen suggested that Hansen help with the recording of Unruly Child's second release, and shortly after they agreed to resurrect Hurricane.
English-born blues guitarist Sean Manning (former bandmate and Kevin Dubrow /Quiet Riot guitarist) (guitar) and Larry Antonino (bass) rounded out the new version of the band, and they released "Liquifury".
Guitarists Carlos Villalobos and Randall Strom also appear as session musicians on this album, performing on one track apiece.
Villalobos also co-wrote the track on which he performs.
In the late 1990s Schellen begins a continuing collaboration World Trade, Conspiracy with Chris Squire (Yes) and with friend and band mate Billy Sherwood.
Schellen joined the popular progressive pop band Asia in 2005 and continues now in Asia Featuring John Payne.
Hansen joined Foreigner, and Aldrich is currently in the Las Vegas production "Raiding The Rock Vault".
Manning went on to form The Exiles with 3 other English expatriates, original Bonham vocalist Paul Rafferty, bassist Paul Stanley, and drummer Terry Muscall.
The band split up in the mid 1990s but a collection of demos, in part co-produced by Pat Benatar guitarist Neil Giraldo, surfaced in 1996 as Sean Manning & Paul Raffery - "The Exiles" (Indivision/SDM), with additional musical contributions by Giraldo, longtime Benatar drummer Myron Grombacher, Greg D'Angelo, and Richard Baker, among others.
In 2010, Robert Sarzo and Tony Cavazo, founding members, reunited and recruited singer Andrew Freeman and drummer Mike Hansen.
They announced a tour and a CD in 2011.
The band is currently on a hiatus.
In 2013, it was announced that Sarzo would be named the new lead guitarist of Geoff Tate's version of Queensrÿche.
Hurricane was the opening act on the 2014 tour with Tate's Queensrÿche.
Sarzo played with both the opening and headlining acts on the entire tour.
Singer Jason Ames handled lead vocal duties on the tour.

Towards The End Of The Morning is a 1967 satirical novel by Michael Frayn about journalists working on a British newspaper during the heyday of Fleet Street.
Its protagonists work to compile the miscellaneous, unimportant parts of the newspaper – the "nature notes" column, the religious "thought for the day", the crossword and so on.
The paper seems sunk in a state of torpor, and the journalists' work is extremely dull.
Feeling their lives and careers are stalled, they spend most of their day complaining about work and dreaming of better things.
John Dyson, the lead protagonist, longs to work in television, and is at last given his chance towards the end of the book.
However, fate seems determined to thwart him. "Towards" was Frayn's third book after "The Tin Men" and "The Russian Interpreter", and is probably based on his experiences at "The Observer" from 1962 to 1968.
A central theme of the book is Dyson's struggle against what he sees as encroaching entropy – indeed, the book was published in the United States under the title Against Entropy.
"Pox" is a liquor commonly used for ceremonial purposes among the Mayans of Mexico and Central America. "Pox" is a liquor made of corn, sugar cane and wheat, very important in mayan culture for its ceremonial uses and is also known as aguardiente.
Besides its religious significance it is also a somewhat popular alcoholic drink in the Chiapas region of Southern Mexico.
The word "pox" in Tzotzil means "medicine, cane liquor, cure."
Pox was commonly used in religious ceremonies and festivals in San Juan Chamula, Chiapas, but increasingly soda has been substituted for it.

In the Battle of Al-Sannabra (1113), a Crusader army led by King Baldwin I of Jerusalem was defeated by a Muslim army sent by the Sultan of the Seljuk Turks and commanded by Mawdud ibn Altuntash of Mosul.
Beginning in 1110, the Seljuk Sultan Muhammad I in Baghdad ordered invasions of the Crusader states for six successive years. "In 1110, 1112, and 1114 the city of Edessa was the objective; in 1113 Galilee was invaded, and in 1111 and 1115 the Latin possessions which lay east of the Orontes between Aleppo and Shaizar."
The attack on Edessa in 1110 failed to take the city.
In 1111, Mawdud of Mosul led a host which fought Baldwin I's Frankish army to a draw in the Battle of Shaizar.
Afterward, the Muslim leader's army dispersed because of its lack of success and plunder.
In 1112 and 1114, the Muslim counterattack against Edessa was weak.
In the other four years, the Crusader states - the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Principality of Antioch, County of Tripoli and County of Edessa - joined forces in defense.
In 1113, Mawdud joined Toghtekin of Damascus and their combined army aimed to cross the Jordan River south of the Sea of Galilee.
Baldwin I offered battle near the bridge of Al-Sannabra.
Mawdud used the device of a feigned flight to entice Baldwin I into rashly ordering a charge.
The Frankish army was surprised and beaten when it unexpectedly ran into the main Turkish army.
The surviving Crusaders kept their cohesion and fell back to a hill west of the inland sea where they fortified their camp.
In this position they were reinforced from Tripoli and Antioch but remained inert.
A number of Christian pilgrims also rallied to the army after Al-Sannabra.
Unable to annihilate the Crusaders, Mawdud watched them with his main army while sending raiding columns to ravage the countryside and sack the town of Nablus.
In this, Mawdud anticipated the strategy of Saladin in two later campaigns that were marked by the Battle of Belvoir Castle (1182) and the Battle of Al-Fule (1183).
As in these campaigns, the Frankish field army could oppose the main Muslim army, but it could not stop raiding forces from doing great damage to crops and towns.
While the Turkish raiders roamed freely through Crusader lands, the local Muslim farmers entered into friendly relations with them.
This deeply troubled the Frankish land magnates, who ultimately depended upon rents from cultivators of the soil.
Mawdud was unable to make any permanent conquests after his victory.
Soon afterward, he was assassinated and Aq-Sunqur Bursuqi took command of the failed attempt against Edessa in 1114.
Roger of Salerno routed the last Seljuk invading army at the Battle of Sarmin after a protracted campaign in 1115.
The Owl is a fictional superhero character who first appeared in Dell Comics in 1940; not to be confused with the Marvel Comics villain of the same name or with DC Comics’ Owlman.
Police detective Nick Terry became The Owl so that he could more freely protect his home city of Yorktown from criminals.
Not having superpowers, he instead relied on his fighting skills and a number of gimmicks, such as his flying “Owlmobile,” a cape that functions as a hang glider, and a hand-held “black light” gun that casts a beam of darkness.
His girlfriend, newspaper reporter Belle Wayne, found out his secret and became his sidekick, Owl Girl.
At some point after World War II, The Owl (along with dozens of other heroes) was trapped in the Urn of Pandora by the misguided Fighting Yank.
Decades later, the Urn was shattered and the heroes freed, many of whom were transformed by the experience.
The Owl now had the power of flight and the power to emanate a field of black light from his body.
He returned to Yorktown and found that it was now being watched over by a ruthless new Owl Girl who was the granddaughter of the original.
One of the few original characters to be published by Dell, The Owl first appeared in "Crackajack Funnies" (sic) #25 (July 1940); Owl Girl debuted in issue #32 (February 1941).
After "Crackajack" ended, the duo appeared in Dell’s "Popular Comics", from issue #72 (February 1942) to #85 (March 1943).
In the 1960s, Gold Key Comics revived The Owl and Owl Girl, inspired by the success of the "Batman" TV series.
The two issues of Gold Key’s "The Owl"—in which the duo was shown in campy, self-parodying stories—came out in April 1967 and April 1968.
The Owl Girl in the revival was a different one from the 1940s version, and in the partnership she handled most of the physical combat.
In the 1970s, The Owl (without either Owl Girl) appeared in issue #22 of Gold Key’s "The Occult Files of Dr. Spektor".
In a text article in that issue, Doctor Spektor speculates that the Owl may have been privy to some kind of secret of prolonged youth, a secret that for some reason could not be shared with Owl Girl.
In 1999, The Owl appeared in issue #17 of the AC Comics title "Men of Mystery Comics".
The Owl is one of many public domain characters to appear in Dynamite Entertainment’s 2008 miniseries "Project Superpowers".
In 2013 Dynamite Entertainment published a 4-issue mini-series starring The Owl and The Owl Girl (this version being the granddaughter of the original) as main characters.
Originally, the Owl had no superpowers but he was an excellent hand to hand combatant.
He wore a cape which allowed him to glide, used a gun that could project "black light" and possessed a flying car called the Owlmobile.
After being released from the Urn of Pandora, the Owl now has the power of flight and the ability to project a field of "black light".
In 2017 InDELLible Comics brought the Owl and Owl Girl (and many other Dell characters) back beginning in a series of graphic novels entitled All-New Popular Comics.
He was also featured in short stories in the InDELLiprose collection.
His abilities echo those of the original Golden Age version, with new supporting characters and villains.

Melrose–Rugby is a Roanoke, Virginia neighborhood located in central Roanoke, that initially developed in the 1890s as an early Roanoke suburb.
It borders the neighborhoods of Roundhill on the north, Washington Park on the east, Loudon-Melrose and Harrison on the south and Fairland and Villa Heights on the west.
Its northern and eastern boundary is concurrent with Interstate 581 and its southern boundary is concurrent with U.S. Route 460 (Melrose Avenue).
Melrose–Rugby developed between 1889 and 1920, as various land companies subdivided and developed the land within the neighborhood.
The primary impetus for the development of the neighborhood was the expansion of the streetcar into Melrose by 1890.
The neighborhood is characterized with American Foursquare and cottage style home towards the south and more modern split-level ranch home towards the northwest.
The Roanoke based Woman's Civic Betterment Club was instrumental in cleaning and improving this area in 1907-1912.
In preparing the Melrose-Rugby Historic District in Roanoke, the effects of the Woman's Civic Betterment Club were appreciated.
Today Melrose–Rugby is the location of the Roanoke Academy for Math and Science, Eureka Park Recreation Center and the J. F. Kennedy Park.
The Melrose–Rugby Neighborhood Forum serves as the communities citizen advocacy group.
The Melrose–Rugby Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

The Field Deployable Hydrolysis System (FDHS) is a transportable, high throughput neutralization system developed by the U.S. Army for converting chemical warfare material into compounds not usable as weapons.
Neutralization is facilitated through chemical reactions involving reagents that are mixed and heated to increase destruction efficiency, which is rated at 99.9 percent.
The transportable FDHS is a self-contained system that includes power generators and a laboratory.
Operational inputs include consumable materials such as water, reagents and fuel.
It is designed to be set up within 10 days and is equipped with redundant critical systems.
An on-site a crew of 15 trained personnel, including SME support, is needed for each shift of a possible 24-hour operational cycle.
A 20-week design and development phase was funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency in February 2013.
The effort to develop a functional prototype was led by subject-matter experts from the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) in partnership with the United States Army Chemical Materials Agency.
An operational model was developed over the course of six months, with the participation of 50 ECBC employees.
Two of these units were deployed on the for use in the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons.
They are the "centerpiece" of the disarmament effort.
The United Kingdom gave the United States £2.5 million of specialist equipment and training to enable the highest-priority chemicals to be processed more quickly.

The Martian Chronicles is a 1950 science fiction short story fixup by Ray Bradbury that chronicles the colonization of Mars by humans fleeing from a troubled and eventually atomically devastated Earth, and the conflict between aboriginal Martians and the new colonists.
The book lies somewhere in between a short story collection and an episodic novel, containing stories Bradbury originally published in the late 1940s in science fiction magazines.
The stories were loosely woven together with a series of short, interstitial vignettes for publication. "The Martian Chronicles" is a fixup of short stories with new text connecting them into a novel.
Bradbury has credited Sherwood Anderson's "Winesburg, Ohio" and John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath" as influences on the structure of the book.
He has called it a "half-cousin to a novel" and "a book of stories pretending to be a novel".
As such, it is similar in structure to Bradbury's short story collection, "The Illustrated Man", which also uses a thin frame story to link various unrelated short stories. "The Martian Chronicles" follows a "future history" structure.
The stories, complete in themselves, come together as episodes in a larger sequential narrative framework.
The overall structure is in three parts, punctuated by two catastrophes: the near-extinction of the Martians and the parallel near-extinction of the human race.
The first third (set in the period from January 1999—April 2000) details the attempts of the Earthmen to reach Mars, and the various ways in which the Martians keep them from returning.
In the crucial story, "—And the Moon be Still as Bright", it is revealed by the fourth exploratory expedition that the Martians have all but perished in a plague caused by germs brought by one of the previous expeditions.
This unexpected development sets the stage for the second act (December 2001—November 2005), in which humans from Earth colonize the deserted planet, occasionally having contact with the few surviving Martians, but for the most part preoccupied with making Mars a second Earth.
However, as war on Earth threatens, most of the settlers pack up and return home.
A global nuclear war ensues, cutting off contact between Mars and Earth.
The third act (December 2005—October 2026) deals with the aftermath of the war, and concludes with the prospect of the few surviving humans becoming the new Martians, a prospect already foreshadowed in "—And the Moon be Still as Bright", and which allows the book to return to its beginning.
The book was published in the United Kingdom under the title "The Silver Locusts" (1951), with slightly different contents.
In some editions the story "The Fire Balloons" was added, and the story "Usher II" was removed to make room for it.
In the Spanish-language version, the stories were preceded by a prologue by Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges.
The book was published in 1963 as part of the Time Reading Program with an introduction by Fred Hoyle.
In 1979, Bantam Books published a trade paperback edition with illustrations by Ian Miller.
A 1997 edition of the book advances all the dates by 31 years (thus running from 2030 to 2057). (This change counteracts a problem common to near-future stories, where the passage of time overtakes the period in which the story is set; for a list of other works that have fallen prey to this phenomenon, see the List of stories set in a future now past.)
This edition includes "The Fire Balloons", and replaces "Way in the Middle of the Air" (a story less topical in 1997 than in 1950) with the 1952 short story "The Wilderness", dated May 2034 (equivalent to May 2003 in the earlier chronology).
Edgar Rice Burroughs's works were key influences.
In an article written shortly before his death, Bradbury said the John Carter of Mars books and Harold Foster's 1931 series of Tarzan Sunday comics had such an impact on his life that ""The Martian Chronicles" would never have happened" otherwise.
In an introduction he wrote for "The Martian Chronicles", Bradbury cited the Barsoom stories and "Winesburg, Ohio" by Sherwood Anderson as literary influences.
The background of Mars shared by most of the stories, as a desert planet crisscrossed by giant canals built by an ancient civilization to bring water from the polar ice caps, is a common scenario in science fiction of the early 20th century.
It stems from early telescope observations of Mars by astronomers from the 19th-century who believed they saw straight lines on the planet, the first of them being the Italian Giovanni Schiaparelli in 1877.
Schiaparelli called them "canali" (a generic Italian term used for both natural and artificial "grooves" or "channels"), which was popularly mistranslated into English as "canals", man-made water channels.
Based on this and other evidence, the idea that Mars was inhabited by intelligent life was put forward by a number of prominent scientists around the turn of the century, notably American astronomer Percival Lowell.
This ignited a popular fascination with the planet which has been called "Mars fever".
Planetary astronomer Carl Sagan wrote: Mars has become a kind of mythic arena onto which we have projected our Earthly hopes and fears.
First published in "Planet Stories", spring 1947.
The stories of the book are arranged in chronological order, starting in January 1999, with the blasting off of the first rocket. "Rocket Summer" is a short vignette which describes Ohio's winter turning briefly into "summer" due to the extreme heat of the rocket's take-off, as well as the reaction of the citizens nearby.
First published as "I'll Not Ask for Wine" in "Maclean's", January 1, 1950.
The following chapter, "Ylla", moves the story to Mars, describing the Martians as having brown skin, yellow eyes, and russet hair.
Ylla, a Martian woman trapped in an unromantic marriage, dreams of the coming astronauts through telepathy.
Her husband, though he pretends to deny the reality of the dreams, becomes bitterly jealous, sensing his wife's inchoate romantic feelings for one of the astronauts.
After taking his gun under the pretense of hunting, he kills astronauts Nathaniel York and "Bert" as soon as they arrive.
First published as "The Spring Night" in "The Arkham Sampler", Winter 1948.
This short vignette tells of Martians throughout Mars who, like Ylla, begin subconsciously picking up stray thoughts from the humans aboard the Second Expedition's ship.
As the ship approaches their planet, the Martians begin to adopt aspects of human culture such as playing and singing American songs, without any idea where the inspirations are coming from.
First published in "Thrilling Wonder Stories", August 1948.
This story tells of the "Second Expedition" to Mars.
The expedition is a group of four men.
The astronauts arrive to find the Martians to be strangely unresponsive to their presence.
The one exception to this is a group of Martians in a building who greet them with a parade.
Several of the Martians in the building claim to be from Earth or from other planets of the solar system, and the captain slowly realizes that the Martian gift for telepathy allows others to view the hallucinations of the insane, and that they have been placed in an insane asylum.
The Martians they have encountered all believed that their unusual appearance was a projected hallucination.
Because the "hallucinations" are so detailed and the captain refuses to admit he is not from Earth, Mr. Xxx, a psychiatrist, declares him incurable and kills him.
When the "imaginary" crew does not disappear as well, Mr. Xxx shoots and kills them too.
Finally, as the "imaginary" rocket remains in existence, Mr. Xxx concludes that he too must be crazy and shoots himself.
The ship of the Second Expedition is sold as scrap at a junkyard.
First appeared in "The Martian Chronicles".
A man insists that he has a right to be on the next rocket to Mars, because he is a taxpayer.
He strongly insists on boarding the ship due to the impending nuclear war on Earth.
He is not allowed on the ship and eventually gets taken away by the police.
First published as "Mars is Heaven!" in "Planet Stories", fall 1948.
The arrival and demise of the third group of Americans to land on Mars is described by this story.
This time the Martians are prepared for the Earthlings.
When the crew arrives, they see an idyllic small town of the 1920s occupied by the long-lost loved ones of the astronauts.
The bewildered and happy crew members ignore their captain's orders and disperse to join their supposed family members.
The Martians use the memories of the astronauts to lure them into their "old" homes where they are killed in the middle of the night.
The next morning, sixteen coffins are carried from sixteen houses and are buried by mourners who sometimes resemble humans and sometimes "something else".
The original short story was set in the 1960s and dealt with characters nostalgic for their childhoods in the Midwestern United States in the 1920s.
In the "Chronicles" version, which takes place forty years later but which still relies on 1920s nostalgia, the story contains a brief paragraph about medical treatments that slow the aging process, so that the characters can be traveling to Mars in the 2000s but still remember the 1920s.
First published in "Thrilling Wonder Stories", June 1948.
The next chapter opens with the men of the Fourth Expedition gathering firewood against the cold Martian evening.
The scientists have found that all of the Martians have died of chickenpox (brought by one of the first three expeditions)—analogous to the devastation of Native American populations by smallpox.
The men, except for the archaeologist Spender and Captain Wilder, become more boisterous.
Spender loses his temper when one of his crew-mates starts dropping empty wine bottles into a clear blue canal and knocks him into the canal.
When questioned by his captain, Spender replies, "We'll rip it up, rip the skin off, and change it to fit ourselves," and that "we Earth Men have a talent for ruining big, beautiful things," referring to Earth.
He leaves the rest of the landing party to explore Martian ruins after one crew member vomits on an ancient tile mosaic.
Spender returns to the rest of the expedition.
He carries a gun and, claiming to be the last Martian, shoots six of his crew-mates, including one with sympathy towards the Martians from his Cherokee ancestry.
Captain Wilder approaches under a white flag and has a short discussion with Spender about how Martians were better than us.
This is because the Martians knew how to combine religion and science, without criticizing and fighting as we humans do.
During which, the archaeologist explains that if he manages to kill off the expedition it may delay human colonization of the planet for a few more years, possibly long enough that the expected nuclear war on Earth will protect Mars from human colonization completely.
Although he opposes Spender's methods, Captain Wilder somewhat agrees with his attitude towards colonization and wishes for him a humane death.
He returns to the others and joins them as they pursue Spender, and Wilder shoots Spender in the chest during the fight before he has the opportunity to be killed by anyone else.
Another member of the crew named Parkhill, uses the ruined town as target practice, so Wilder knocks his teeth out.
Many of the characters of the Fourth Expedition—Parkhill, Captain Wilder, and Hathaway—re-appear in later stories.
This is the first story that focuses on a central motif of "The Martian Chronicles": the colonization of the Western frontier in the United States.
Like Spender, Bradbury's message is that some types of colonization are right and others are wrong.
Trying to recreate Earth is viewed as wrong, but an approach that respects the fallen civilization that is being replaced is right.
In some editions the two stories relating to Spender were combined as one.
First appeared in "The Martian Chronicles".
In the previously mentioned version, this short story describes the first settlers coming to Mars, the "Lonely Ones", the ones that came to start over on the planet.
First appeared in "The Martian Chronicles".
The next several chapters describe the transformation of Mars into another Earth.
Small towns similar to those on Earth begin to grow.
In "The Green Morning", Benjamin Driscoll makes it his mission to plant thousands of trees on the red plains to increase oxygen levels.
Due to some property of the Martian soil, the trees grow into a mighty forest overnight.

This vignette concerns the swift colonization of Mars.
The title refers to the rockets and settlers which quickly spread across all of Mars.
First appeared in "The Martian Chronicles".
This story begins with a conversation between an old man and a young traveler, Tomás Gomez.
The older man explains that he came to Mars because he appreciates the new and novel.
Even everyday things have become amazing to him once again.
He has returned full circle to his childhood.
Later, Tomás encounters a Martian named Muhe Ca.
Each can see the Mars he is accustomed to, in his own time frame, but the other person is translucent and intangible to him and has the appearance of a phantom.
The young man sees ruins where the Martian sees a thriving city, while the Martian sees an ocean where Tomás sees the new Earth settlement.
Neither knows if he precedes the other in time, but Bradbury makes the point that any one civilization is ultimately fleeting.
This is the only full-length story in "The Martian Chronicles" that had not previously appeared in another publication.
This story describes the rippling outward of colonization, the first wave being loner, pioneer types, and the second, also Americans, being from the "cabbage tenements and subways" of New York City.
First appeared as "…In This Sign" in "Imagination", April 1951.
A missionary expedition of Episcopal priests from the United States anticipates sins unknown to them on Mars.
Instead, they meet ethereal creatures glowing as blue flames in crystal spheres, who have left behind the material world, and thus have escaped sin.
This story appeared only in "The Silver Locusts", the British edition of "The Martian Chronicles", the 1974 edition from The Heritage Press, the September 1979 illustrated trade edition from Bantam Books, the "40th Anniversary Edition" from Doubleday Dell Publishing Group and in the 2001 Book-of-the-Month Club edition.
It otherwise appeared in "The Illustrated Man".
First appeared in "Weird Tales", July 1947.
This story describes the building of a Martian town by colonists and how much it was made to resemble an average Midwestern American town.
The town was said to have appeared to have been swept up by a tornado on Earth, and brought to Mars.
First appeared in "The Martian Chronicles".
Several boys venture into the ruins of Martian cities.
They enter houses and play with the debris, imagining that they are on Earth playing with the autumn leaves.
They have fun playing "white xylophones"—Martian ribcages.
They play with a sense of urgency because the Firemen are due to arrive soon, cleaning and disinfecting the ruins and destroying this source of fun.
First appeared in "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction", November 1952.
Two women, Janice Smith and Leonora Holmes, prepare to depart on a rocket to Mars, to find husbands or lovers waiting for them there.
Janice muses on the terrors of space, drinks in last memories of the Earth she will soon be leaving, and compares her situation to that of the pioneer women of the 19th-century American frontier.
This story only appears in the 1974 edition of "The Martian Chronicles" by The Heritage Press, the 1979 Bantam Books illustrated trade edition, and the 1997 edition of "The Martian Chronicles".
In its original form, the story was dated 2003, and this date is consistent with the other stories.
As it appears in the 1997 edition, the date (together with all the other dates) has been shifted ahead 31 years, to May 2034.
First appeared in "Other Worlds", July 1950.
In an unnamed Southern town, a group of white men learn that all African Americans are planning to emigrate to Mars.
Samuel Teece, a racist white man, decries their departure as a flood of African Americans passes his hardware store.
He tries to stop one man, Belter, from leaving due to an old debt, but others quickly take up a collection on his behalf to pay it off.
Next he tries to detain Silly, a younger man who works for him, saying that he signed a contract and must honor it.
As Silly protests, claiming that he never signed it, one of Teece's friends volunteers to take his place.
Several of Teece's friends stand up to him and intimidate him into letting Silly depart.
As Silly drives off, he yells to Teece, "What you goin' to "do" nights?" - referring to Teece's nightly activities with a gang that had terrorized and lynched blacks in the area.
The enraged Teece and a friend give chase in his car, but soon find the road cluttered with the discarded belongings of the rocket passengers.
After they return to the hardware store, Teece refuses to watch as the rockets lift off.
Wondering how he and his friends will spend their nights from now on, he takes a small triumph in the fact that Silly always addressed him as "Mister" even as he was leaving.
This episode is a depiction of racial prejudice in America.
However, it was eliminated from the 2006 William Morrow/Harper Collins, and the 2001 DoubleDay Science Fiction reprinting of the book.
First appeared in "The Martian Chronicles".
Not to be confused with the short story "The Naming of Names", first published in "Thrilling Wonder Stories", August 1949, later published as "Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed".
This story is about later waves of immigrants to Mars, and how the geography of Mars is now largely named after the people from the first four expeditions (e.g., Spender Hill, Driscoll Forest) rather than after physical descriptions of the terrain.
First published as "Carnival of Madness" in "Thrilling Wonder Stories", April 1950. "Usher II" is about censorship.
William Stendahl is a book lover who has retreated to Mars after the government confiscated and destroyed his vast collection.
On Mars, he constructs his image of the perfect haunted mansion, complete with mechanical creatures, creepy soundtracks, and thousands of tons of poison to kill every living thing in the surrounding area.
He is assisted by Pikes, a film aficionado and former actor whose collection was confiscated and destroyed by the government and who was subsequently banned from performing.
When the "Moral Climate Monitors" come to visit, Stendahl and Pikes arrange to kill each of them in ways that allude to different horror masterpieces, culminating in the murder of Inspector Garrett in a sequence reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe's "The Cask of Amontillado".
Once Stendahl's persecutors are dead, he and Pikes watch from a helicopter as the house crumbles and sinks into the lake as in Poe’s short story "The Fall of the House of Usher".
At the end of this story, Poe (or Stendahl) hints that the "Moral Climate Monitors" could have avoided these deaths if they had only read the books they banned, since then they would have recognized what was happening to them.
Bradbury hints at past events on Earth, set in 1975–30 years prior to the events in "Usher II".
The government sponsored a "Great Burning" of books and made them illegal, which leads to the formation of an underground society of book owners.
Those found to possess books had them seized and burned by fire crews.
Mars apparently emerged as a refuge from the fascist censorship laws of Earth, until the arrival of a government organization referred to only as "Moral Climates" and their enforcement divisions, the "Dismantlers" and "Burning Crew".
Bradbury would reuse the concept of massive government censorship (to the point of abolishing all literature) in his book "Fahrenheit 451".
In 2010, Los Angeles artist Allois, in collaboration with Bradbury, released illustrated copies of "Usher" and "Usher II".
First appeared in "The Martian Chronicles".
A very brief prelude to the following story, describing the immigration of elderly people to Mars.
First published in "Super Science Stories", November 1949.
LaFarge and his wife Anna have forged a new life for themselves, but they still miss their dead son Tom.
A night thunderstorm startles the elderly pair, who see a figure standing outside their home in the rain.
When morning comes, "Tom" is busy helping Anna with chores.
LaFarge sees that Anna is somehow unaware of Tom's death, and after speaking privately with him, LaFarge learns that "Tom" is a Martian with an empathic shapeshifting ability: the Martian appears as their dead son to them.
Later that day, Anna insists on a visit to the town. "Tom" is deathly afraid of being so close to so many people.
LaFarge promises to keep him close, but at the town they become separated.
While searching for "Tom", LaFarge hears that the Spaulding family in town has miraculously found their lost daughter Lavinia.
Desperate to avoid a second devastating heartbreak to his wife, LaFarge stands outside Spaulding's home and finds "Tom" now masquerading as Lavinia.
He is able to coax "Tom" to come back, and they run desperately back for their boat to leave town.
However, everyone "Tom" passes sees someone significant to them—a lost husband, a son, a wanted criminal.
The Martian, exhausted from his constant shape-changing, spasms and dies.
First appeared in "The Martian Chronicles".
The story of Mars and its inhabitants is continued in a discussion between a priest and a luggage storeowner.
Nuclear war is imminent on Earth, and the priest predicts that most of the colonists will return to help.
First published in "Thrilling Wonder Stories", December 1948.
On Mars, former Fourth Expedition member Sam Parkhill has opened a hot-dog stand and is expecting a huge rush of business as soon as the next wave of settlers and workers arrives from Earth.
When a lone Martian walks in one night, Parkhill panics and kills him.
Other Martians arrive in sand ships, prompting Parkhill and his wife to flee across the desert in their own ship.
Once the Martians catch up, they surprise Parkhill by giving him ownership of half the planet.
He returns to his hot-dog stand just in time to witness the start of the nuclear war on Earth, which puts an end to the settler flights and his business.
First appeared in "The Martian Chronicles".
The colonists witness a nuclear war on Earth from Mars.
They immediately return out of concern for their friends and families, buying up the luggage store owner's entire inventory before they leave.
First published in "Charm", March 1949.
Everybody has left Mars to go to Earth, except Walter Gripp—a single miner who lives in the mountains and does not hear of the departure.
At first excited by his find of an empty town, he enjoys himself with money, food, clothes, and movies.
He soon realizes he misses human companionship.
One night he hears a telephone ringing in someone's home, and suddenly realizes that someone else is alive on Mars.
Missing the call, and several others, he sits down with a phone book of Mars and starts dialing at A.
After days of calling without answers, he starts calling hotels.
After guessing where he thinks a woman would most likely spend her time, he calls the biggest beauty salon on Mars and is delighted when a woman answers.
They talk, but are cut off.
Overcome with romantic dreams, he drives hundreds of miles to New Texas City, only to realize that she drove to find him on a back road.
He drives back to his town, and meets Genevieve Selsor as he pulls in.
Their meeting is the opposite of what he had hoped for in his dreams; she is unattractive (due to her weight and pallor), foolish, and insipid.
After a sullen day, she slyly proposes marriage to him at dinner, as they believe they are the last man and the last woman on Mars.
Gripp flees, driving across Mars to another tiny town to spend his life happily alone, avoiding all contact with Genevieve and ignoring any phone he hears ringing.
First published as "Dwellers in Silence" in "Maclean's", September 15, 1948.
Hathaway (the physician/archaeologist from the Fourth Expedition), now retired, is living on Mars with his wife and children in the hills above an old, abandoned settlement, vacated many years ago when everyone returned to Earth at the beginning of the war there.
A gifted inventor and tinkerer, he has wired the old ghost town in the valley below so that he can make it come alive at night with lights and sounds as if it were still inhabited.
One night, he sees a rocket approaching Mars and sets fire to the old town to attract the attention of those on board.
On board the rocket is his old commander, Captain Wilder (also from the earlier stories about the Fourth Expedition), returning to Mars after twenty years exploring the outer solar system.
He and his crew land and are met by Hathaway, now old and suffering from heart disease.
Hathaway brings the crew to his house for breakfast and introduces them to his family.
Wilder, who remembers meeting Hathaway's wife many years earlier, remarks that she looks remarkably young, while Hathaway has aged considerably.
Wilder pales when he and one of his crew realize that Hathaway's son, who gives his age as 23, must be at least in his forties.
Wilder sends the crewmember off to the local cemetery to check the headstones.
He returns to report that he has found the graves of every member of the family but Hathaway.
Wilder offers to take Hathaway back to Earth, but he declines.
In the next moment, Hathaway has a heart attack and dies, begging Wilder not to call his family to his side because they "would not understand".
Wilder then confirms that Hathaway's wife and children are actually androids, created by Hathaway after the originals died years ago.
As Wilder prepares to depart, one of the crew returns to the house with a pistol, thinking to put an end to the androids, whose existence seems pointless now that Hathaway is gone, but he returns shortly, having been unable to bring himself to kill the robotic family even knowing that they are not truly human.
The rocket departs, and the android family continues on with its meaningless routine.
First published in "Collier's", May 6, 1950.
The story concerns a household in Allendale, California, after the nuclear war has wiped out the population.
Though the family is dead, the automated house that had taken care of the family still functions.
The reader learns a great deal about what the family was like from how the robots continue on in their functions.
Breakfast is automatically made, clothes are laid out, voice reminders of daily activities are called out, but no one is there.
Robotic mice vacuum the home and tidy up.
As the day progresses, the rain quits, and the house prepares lunch and opens like a flower to the warm weather.
A starving dog, apparently the family pet, whines at the door, is admitted and dies.
Outside, a vivid image is given: the family's silhouettes were permanently burned onto the side of the house (as occurred at Hiroshima) when they were vaporized by the nuclear explosion.
That night, a storm crashes a tree into the home, starting a fire that the house cannot combat, as the municipal water supply has dried up and failed.
By the next morning, the entire house has collapsed except for one wall that announces the date over and over.
The title of the story comes from a randomly selected bedtime poem called "There Will Come Soft Rains", which is an actual poem by Sara Teasdale published in 1920.
The theme of the poem is that nature will survive after humanity destroys itself in a war, but the story takes pains to show that this is not the case; if we were to destroy ourselves in a nuclear war we would take nature with us.
In the original story in "Collier's", the story takes place 35 years in the future.
First published in "Planet Stories", summer 1946.
A family saves a rocket that the government would have used in the nuclear war and leaves Earth on a "fishing trip" to Mars.
The family picks a city to live in and call home, destroying the rocket so that they cannot return to Earth.
They enter and the father burns tax documents and other government papers in a campfire, explaining that he is burning a misguided way of life.
A map of Earth is the last thing to be burned.
Later, he offers his sons a gift in the form of their new world.
He introduces them to the Martians—their own reflections in a canal. "The Martian Chronicles: The Complete Edition" published by Subterranean Press (2010) contains "The Other Martian Tales" section: Boucher and McComas praised "Chronicles" as "a poet's interpretation of future history beyond the limits of any fictional form".
In his "Books" column for "F&SF", Damon Knight listed "The Martian Chronicles" on his top-ten science fiction books of the 1950s.
Algis Budrys called it "a beautiful Bradbury collection which owes part of its charm to the loose connecting passages", and an exception to the many poor-quality fixups of the 1950s.
L. Sprague de Camp, however, declared that Bradbury would improve "when he escapes from the influence of Hemingway and Saroyan", placing him in "the tradition of anti-science-fiction writers [who] see no good in the machine age".
Still, de Camp acknowledged that "[Bradbury's] stories have considerable emotional impact, and many will love them".
Sagan listed "The Martian Chronicles" as among the "rare few science‐fiction novels [that] combine a standard science‐fiction theme with a deep human sensitivity".
Robert Crossley (University of Massachusetts Boston) has suggested that the story "Way in the Middle of the Air" might be considered "the single most incisive episode of black and white relations in science fiction by a white author."
The theater debut of "The Martian Chronicles" was at the Cricket Theater (The Ritz) in Northeast Minneapolis in 1976.
A musical version is being developed in New York City in 2017.
MGM bought the film rights in 1960 but no film was made.
In 1988, the Soviet Armenian studio Armenfilm produced the feature film "The 13th Apostle", starring Juozas Budraitis, Donatas Banionis, Armen Dzhigarkhanyan, based on "The Martian Chronicles".
The film was directed by Armenian actor and screenwriter, Suren Babayan.
The Uzbek filmmaker Nozim To'laho'jayev made two films based on sections from the book: 1984's animated short "There Will Come Soft Rains" (Russian: Будет ласковый дождь) and 1987's full-length live action film "Veld" (Russian: Вельд), with one of the subplots based on "The Martian". "The Martian Chronicles" was adapted as a full-length contemporary opera by composer Daniel Levy and librettist Elizabeth Margid.
This is the only musical adaptation authorized by Bradbury himself, who turned down Lerner and Loewe in the 1960s when they asked his permission to make a musical based on the novel.
The work received its initial readings from the Harriet Lake Festival of New Plays at the Orlando Shakespeare Theater in 2006, and was presented in workshop form in the inaugural season of the Fordham University Lincoln Center Alumni Company in 2008.
The NIGHT MEETING episode was presented at Cornelia Street Cafe's ENTERTAINING SCIENCE series on June 9, 2013.
The entire work was presented as a staged reading with a cast of Broadway actors at Ars Nova NYC on February 11, 2015.
Three scenes were presented as a workshop production with immersive staging, directed by Carlos Armesto of Theatre C and conducted by Benjamin Smoulder at Miami University, Oxford OH on September 17–19, 2015. "The Martian Chronicles" was adapted for radio in the science fiction radio series "Dimension X".
This truncated version contained elements of the stories "Rocket Summer", "Ylla", "–and the Moon be Still as Bright", "The Settlers", "The Locusts", "The Shore", "The Off Season", "There Will Come Soft Rains", and "The Million-Year Picnic". "—and the Moon be Still as Bright" and "There Will Come Soft Rains" were also adapted for separate episodes in the same series.
The short stories "Mars Is Heaven" and "Dwellers in Silence" also appeared as episodes of "Dimension X".
The latter is in a very different form from the one found in "The Martian Chronicles".
A very abridged spoken word reading of "There Will Come Soft Rains" and "Usher II" was made in 1975 with Leonard Nimoy as narrator.
A BBC Radio 4 adaption, produced by Andrew Mark Sewell as an hour-long programme and starring Derek Jacobi as Captain Wilder, was broadcast on 21 June 2014 as part of the "Dangerous Visions" series.
In 1979 NBC partnered with the BBC to commission "The Martian Chronicles", a three-episode miniseries adaptation running just over four hours.
It was written by Richard Matheson and was directed by Michael Anderson.
Rock Hudson starred as Wilder, Darren McGavin as Parkhill, Bernadette Peters as Genevieve Selsor, Bernie Casey as Jeff Spender, Roddy McDowall as Father Stone, and Barry Morse as Hathaway, as well as Fritz Weaver.
Bradbury found the miniseries "just boring".
The cable television series "The Ray Bradbury Theater" adapted some individual short stories from "The Martian Chronicles" including "Mars is Heaven", "Usher II", "And the Moon Be Still as Bright", "The Long Years" and "The Martian".
Video releases of the series included a VHS tape entitled "Ray Bradbury's Chronicles: The Martian Episodes " with some editions with three episodes and others with five.
Several of the short stories in "The Martian Chronicles" were adapted into graphic novel-style stories in the EC Comics magazines, including "There Will Come Soft Rains" in "Weird Fantasy" #17, "The Million-Year Picnic" in "Weird Fantasy" #21 and "The Silent Towns" in "Weird Fantasy" #22.
In 2011, Hill & Wang published "Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles: The Authorized Adaptation" as a graphic novel, with art by Dennis Calero.
Raymond Terrence Hoser (born 1962), who describes himself as a herpetologist, is an Australian snake-catcher and author.
Since 1976, he has written books and articles about official corruption in Australia.
He has also written works on Australian frogs and reptiles and operates a snake handling business, Snakebusters, in Melbourne.
Some of Hoser's work is controversial, including his advocacy of the surgical alteration of captive snakes to remove their venom glands and his herpetological taxonomy.
Hoser has published several works as a whistleblower.
In a 1998 radio interview he said that he was "known as an anti-corruption crusader".
An analysis of his work by the Rationalist Society of Australia referred to him as a "tireless investigator" and he has received praise from Brian Martin, a former president of Whistleblowers Australia.
In his 1993 book "Smuggled", Hoser wrote that officials of the wildlife services in New South Wales were involved in the illegal wildlife trade.
In 1995, Hoser published "The Hoser Files", detailing his encounters with Victoria Police and the Road Traffic Authority in Melbourne while working as a taxi driver. (Hoser had moved to Victoria in 1985.)
Hoser has also written about the taxonomy of Australian snakes, describing new species and genera, and suggesting revisions to current arrangements.
The majority of these nominations have not been accepted.
Hoser's work has been a source of controversy in the field of herpetology, with a 2001 review in "Litteratura Serpentium" strongly criticising his publications as "less than professional", describing them as a source of confusion and wasted effort.
The review claimed that Hoser provided no description of the holotype or type specimen for most of his new species, and argued that Hoser's alleged errors could have been avoided had the articles been published in a peer-reviewed, rather than amateur and non-institutional, journal.
Charges of ethical misconduct were made in this article.
Further criticism of Hoser's work was published in 2006, in a review that stated that "the level of evidence provided by Hoser to justify his taxonomic acts is minimal" and charged that several of his publications appear to have been made with the intention of scooping other workers in the field, behavior that the authors described as "ethically repugnant".
Some of Hoser's papers have been discussed in scientific journals in Australia and elsewhere; while his papers were published in journals that critics claim are either the publications of amateur herpetological societies, or self-published, non-peer reviewed journals.
In a 2007 article on amateur naturalists in "Nature", Hoser responded to criticisms of his work. "The description of me as an amateur is complete rubbish," he said.
"There's no one in history who has spent so much time dealing with, looking at, catching and breeding death adders as myself."
He is the author of the valid names and descriptions for "Pseudechis pailsei" and "Acanthophis wellsi", snakes in the family Elapidae.
Hoser's work on the taxonomy of the Pythoninae has been partially confirmed by later phylogenetic studies, but has not been officially recognized.
In 2009, Hoser started his own journal, the "Australasian Journal of Herpetology", for which he is editor and, as of August 2014, the sole contributing author of all 24 issues containing 102 papers.
The taxon count for issues 1–24 (years 2009–2014) of the "Australasian Journal of Herpetology" is 752 taxa, i.e. two superfamilies, nine families, 11 subfamilies, 119 tribes, 55 subtribes, 198 genera, 183 subgenera, 96 species, and 79 subspecies.
In 2012, Hoser received criticism from several crocodile zoologists after he named what he claimed to be new species of pygmy freshwater crocodile, based on a single population discovered in 1979 in the upper Liverpool River in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory of Australia by noted zoologist and current IUCN Crocodile Specialist Group Chair Grahame Webb.
Webb argued that the crocodiles were a merely clinal variation of the Johnston crocodile which is stunted in size because of lack of food in the area, and not a new species.
Crocodile geneticist Sally Isberg stated that Hoser had not presented the required molecular genetic data to prove that a new species exists and claimed that Hoser's journal is not peer-reviewed.
However, molecular genetic evidence is not a requirement for the naming of new species.
In 2013, a group of international herpetologists published a paper in the "Herpetological Review", a peer-reviewed publication of the Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.
The paper, which included the names of over 60 of the world's academic herpetologists as supporters, and many of the major societies including the World Congress of Herpetology, set out to put a stop to the "taxonomic vandalism" of Hoser and another self-publishing herpetologist, Richard Wells.
It dismissed as unscientific, and lacking in evidence, scientific rigor, or credibility, the huge number of names coined by Hoser since 2000, mostly in his self-published, self-edited, single-authored "Australasian Journal of Herpetology", and provided authors with the original or alternative, more acceptable, names.
The paper also dealt with a smaller number of names coined by Wells.
In June 2013, "Scientific American" author Darren Naish published a concise account of the situation in his Tetrapod Zoology blog.
In 2013, the British Herpetological Society and the Netherlands Association for Herpetoculture adopted resolutions censuring Hoser for naming reptiles without scientific evidence or peer review and what they deemed as "vanity publishing".
The editor of the Herpetological Association of Africa published an online editorial which stated that the "African Journal of Herpetology" would not use any names listed in Table 1 of Kaiser "et al." 2013.
Recently, there have been several papers published by groups of herpetologists, that over-write or ignore Hoser's names.
Most notable are Reynolds "et al." 2013, which provides a more acceptable name, "Malayopython", in place of Hoser's "Broghammerus" for the reticulated python, and Thomas "et al."
2014, which provides two new species names for the alligator snapping turtle, that over-write Hoser's poorly defined taxa.
Hoser's response includes calling the journals (respectively "Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution" and "Zootaxa") PRINO (peer-reviewed in name only), a term he coined himself for rival journals.
Both these decisions are controversial at present and the ICZN may be called to adjudicate on which nomenclature should be adopted.
The dispute has also been picked up by mainstream media, including the Smithsonian.
A 2016 paper examined four of Hoser's publications on Agamidae and found that large sections of text were plagiarized from multiple other authors, including whole paragraphs.
Hoser is an author and publisher of a number of books and a website on frogs and reptiles, and has a business as a snake handler.
He runs the website "smuggled.com", which contains articles about official corruption and reptiles.
Hoser runs a business called Snakebusters in Melbourne, providing reptiles for children's birthday parties and catching and moving snakes in urban areas.
As part of his business, Hoser claims the title "Snakeman" (and others) as trademarks and has asked a number of people, including New South Wales volunteer snake-catcher George Ellis, Gold Coast snake catcher Tony Harrison, and Clarence Valley Wildlife Information and Rescue Service (WIRES) snake rescuer and reptile co-ordinator Paul Jones to cease using the name "snakeman", threatening legal action for trademark infringement if they refused.
At the time of Hoser's complaint in 2012, Jones had been a volunteer with Clarence Valley WIRES for 17 years and, in that time, had rescued and rehabilitated more than a thousand reptiles.
He has also taken the same response to herpetologists using the name "snakeman" in other countries.
After an increase in snakebites, Hoser criticized the zookeeper, conservationist and television personality Steve Irwin to "The Age" newspaper (of Melbourne, Australia), saying that Irwin had "given many people false ideas about how to behave around snakes".
Hoser said, "The way he handled snakes on TV was not the right way to do it.
Some people don't seem to understand that if you play with deadly animals, you may end up dead."
Hoser is an advocate of venomoid snakes, surgically altered to remove venom, and has published discussion on this topic, and promoted the procedure on his website.
These animals are kept as pets, or used in exhibitions to the general public, and the procedure is regarded as controversial.
A 2008 government tribunal ruled that Hoser's venomoid snakes cannot be handled by members of the public, due to the risk of the venom glands regrowing.
VCAT Deputy President Anne Coghlan found Hoser had no qualifications, no training and produced no scientific evidence to back up his claims.
In 2001, the Victorian Supreme Court used the offence of "scandalising the court" to fine Hoser $5,000 after he published names of two county court judges and two magistrates in a book entitled "Victoria Police Corruption" with allegations of bias and improper conduct.
Hoser's 2003 appeal against the charge was unsuccessful and he was found guilty of a second contempt charge which was originally dismissed.
In 2011, Hoser was convicted and fined $12,000 in the County Court for demonstrating with venomous snakes less than three metres from the public, working in accessible pits and demonstrating in a way that put the animals at risk of theft.
Hoser allowed his 10-year-old daughter to be bitten five times by venomoid specimens of two species of highly venomous snakes, an inland taipan and a common death adder, to demonstrate that his venomoid snakes were harmless.
The manager of the shopping center where Hoser performed claimed that Hoser's performance was not consistent with his act description and said that Hoser would not be allowed back.
Following this incident, the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) suspended Hoser's commercial wildlife demonstrator license and his authorisation to hold snake-handling courses and use wildlife in film and television.
Hoser said that he would apply to the courts for an emergency injunction against this suspension.
In May 2013, Hoser appealed to the Victoria Court of Appeal in an attempt to overturn the Department of Sustainability and Environment's (DSE) decision to cancel his wildlife demonstrators licence and Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) deputy president Judge Pamela Jenkins's decision in 2012 to uphold that DSE cancellation of his license.
In 2012, Judge Jenkins had found Hoser intentionally allowed two snakes to bite his daughter 7 times, and compromised both the safety of the audience and the welfare of the snakes during his demonstration.
According to the Daily Examiner newspaper, Jenkins in March 9, 2012 had upheld a previous appeal by Hoser (of the DSE actions against him), fining Hoser $4,000 under the Wildlife Safety Act and ordering Hoser to pay the costs of the DSE of $8,000.
Jenkins had found that "through his demeanour and evidence, displayed a contempt and reckless disregard for the licence conditions.
He has conducted his demonstrations in a manner which seriously compromises the welfare of the snakes he is displaying and the safety and well-being of audience members, including children and, on one occasion, his own daughter."
In March 2013, Justice Robert Redlich of the Victoria Court of Appeal recommended that Hoser hire a lawyer to represent him (rather than representing himself) and adjourned the hearing until 13 June 2013.
In 2012, Hoser ran for council of the City of Manningham (Mullum Mullum ward), but failed to win one of three positions.
He received 4.31% of the primary vote.
In 1999, Hoser ran in the Victorian state election 1999 in Frankston East district.
He received the fewest votes (11 out of 26,842 votes or 0.04% of first preference votes).
Hoser has written letters to major newspapers, and signs these in three ways: with his own name, a random one to maintain anonymity, and obvious joke names such as Wayne Kerr and Wayne King,
Laurens ("Lau") Siebrand Mulder (7 July 1927 in Batavia, Dutch East Indies – 29 January 2006 in Uithoorn) was a Dutch field hockey player who competed in the 1952 Summer Olympics.
He was a member of the Dutch field hockey team, which won the silver medal.
He played all three matches as goalkeeper.
Rubus tygartensis is a rare North American species of flowering plants in the rose family.
It has been found only in West Virginia in the east-central United States.
The genetics of "Rubus" is extremely complex, so that it is difficult to decide on which groups should be recognized as species.
There are many rare species with limited ranges such as this.
Further study is suggested to clarify the taxonomy.
The Australian Labor Party split of 1916 occurred following severe disagreement within the Australian Labor Party over the issue of proposed World War I conscription in Australia.
Labor Prime Minister of Australia Billy Hughes had, by 1916, become an enthusiastic supporter of conscription as a means to boost Australia's contribution to the war effort.
On 30 August 1916, he announced plans for a referendum on the issue (the Australian plebiscite, 1916), and introduced enabling legislation into parliament on 14 September, which passed only with the support of the opposition.
Six of Hughes' ministers resigned in protest at the move, and the New South Wales state branch of the Labor Party expelled Hughes.
The referendum saw an intense campaign in which Labor figures vehemently advocated on each side of the argument, although the "no" campaign narrowly won on 14 November.
In the wake of the referendum defeat, the caucus moved to expel Hughes on 14 November; instead, he and 23 supporters resigned and formed the National Labor Party.
Frank Tudor was elected leader of the rump party.
Hughes was recommissioned as Prime Minister, heading a minority government supported by the opposition Commonwealth Liberal Party; the two parties then merged as the Nationalist Party of Australia and won the 1917 federal election.
The Nationalist Party served as the main conservative party of Australia until 1931, and the split resulted in many early Labor figures ending their careers on the political right.
The split had different impacts in different states.
In Queensland there was no significant split at all, with the state Labor Party having experienced the loss of many early members a decade earlier when William Kidston led a breakaway group out in 1907.
During the war Premier T. J. Ryan made strong efforts to minimise losses.
Only one member of the state parliament, John Adamson, left the party and initially there was no attempt to create an alternate vehicle at the state level.
However in October 1919 Adamson was part of the formation of a National Labor Party for ex-Labor supporters that used the name.
It had no electoral success and soon disappeared.
Biosphere reserves are areas comprising terrestrial, marine and coastal ecosystems.
The "biosphere reserve" title is handed over by UNESCO.
Each reserve promotes solutions reconciling the conservation of biodiversity with its sustainable use.
Biosphere reserves are ‘Science for Sustainability support sites’ – special places for testing interdisciplinary approaches to understanding and managing changes and interactions between social and ecological systems, including conflict prevention and management of biodiversity.
Biosphere reserves are nominated by national governments and remain under the sovereign jurisdiction of the states where they are located.
Their status is internationally recognized.
The Philippines currently has three UNESCO Biosphere Reserves.
The first Biosphere of the country was designated in 1977.
The Palawan Biosphere Reserve is the only biosphere reserve in the country that contains a Ramsar Wetland Site (Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park) and two UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Tubbataha Reefs National Park and the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park) The Philippines became a committee member of the Man and Biosphere Programme of UNESCO in 2016 and shall retain the position until 2019.
Ecological frontiers like Eastern Mindanao, Eastern Visayas, Sibuyan island, Western Panay, the Sierra Madre, Southern Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago, and the Cordilleras are theoretically capable of standing as UNESCO Biosphere Reserves in the future, along with specific Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) designated by Haribon Foundation and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (Philippines).
In comparison to the 3 biosphere reserve of the Philippines, Indonesia has 11 biosphere reserves, China has 33, India has 10, Iran has 11, Japan has 9, Kazakhstan has 8, South Korea has 5, Sri Lanka has 4, and Vietnam has 9.
The Philippines is one of the 18 ecological hotpot countries of the world, containing more than 228 Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs).
Albay is the latest to be added to UNESCO's World Network of Biosphere Reserves in 2016.
The government plans to nominate reserves in the Philippines annually once its committee membership ends.
Exclusive UNESCO Biosphere reserved refer to reserved locating in a single community/region.
Shared reserves refer to reserved with entries in multiple communities/regions.
In July 27, 2018, the provincial government of Apayao announced their intent to start the long process to declare the "Calanasan" rainforests as a protected area and a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve or World Heritage Site.
The site is the stronghold of Philippine eagles in Luzon, the largest island in the Philippines.
The province also noted that they have sent four of their personnel to train in the United States under the US Foreign Service to hasten the declaration of the site.
Noi peccatori (i.e. "We, sinners") is a 1953 Italian melodrama film directed by Guido Brignone and starring Yvonne Sanson.
Bedford Gardens is a street in Kensington, London.
It runs west-east from Campden Hill Road to Kensington Church Street.
The street was originally called Bedford Place.
In 1824, William Hall the elder and William Hall the younger planned to build more or less identical late Georgian terraces on both sides of the street.
Only the eastern halves were finished, due to the sudden death of William Hall the younger in 1829 or 1830.
The western end was developed largely with semi-detached houses.
Marie Rambert had a ballet school and studio there in 1920, and remained there until 1927, when she moved to the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate, which became the home of the Ballet Rambert until 1987.
In the early 1980s, Roger Tully purchased Rambert's late nineteenth-century dance studio in Bedford Gardens.
Number 77 became a studio and living space for several artists; Robert Colquhoun, Robert MacBryde and John Minton, as well as Jankel Adler.
Notable residents have included:
The onager (British /ˈɒnədʒə/, /ˈɒnəɡə/, U.S. /ˈɑnədʒər/) was an imperial-era Roman torsion powered siege engine; in other words, a small catapult.
The onager was first mentioned in 353 AD by Ammianus Marcellinus, who described onagers as the same as a scorpion.
According to two authors of the later Roman Empire who wrote on military affairs, the onager derived its name from the kicking action of the machine that threw stones into the air, as did the hooves of the wild ass, the onager, which was native to the eastern part of the empire.
The onager consisted of a large frame placed on the ground to whose front end a vertical frame of solid timber was rigidly fixed.
A vertical spoke that passed through a rope bundle fastened to the frame had a sling attached which contained a projectile.
To fire it, the spoke or arm was forced down, against the tension of twisted ropes or other springs, by a windlass, and then suddenly released.
As the sling swung outwards, one end would release, as with a staff-sling, and the projectile would be hurled forward.
The arm would then be caught by a padded beam or bed, when it could be winched back again.
The onagers of the Roman Empire were mainly used for besieging forts or settlements.
They would often be armed with large stones that could be covered with a combustible substance and set alight.
The onager was used from the 4th century AD until the 6th century AD.
The late-fourth century author Ammianus Marcellinus describes 'onager' as a neologism for scorpions and relates various incidents in which the engines fire both rocks and arrow-shaped missiles.
The late-fourth or early-fifth century military writer Vegetius stipulates that a legion ought to field ten onagers, one for each cohort.
These he says should be transported fully assembled on ox carts to ensure readiness in case of sudden attack, in which case the onagers could be used for defence immediately.
For Vegetius, the onagers were stone throwing machines.
In the late 6th century the Avars brought the Chinese traction trebuchet, otherwise known as the mangonel, to the Mediterranean, where it soon replaced the slower and more complex torsion powered engines.
Viscount Kemsley, of Dropmore in Buckingham county, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.
It was created in 1945 for the press lord Gomer Berry, 1st Baron Kemsley.
He had already been created a Baronet, of Dropmore in the County of Buckingham, on 25 January 1928, and Baron Kemsley, of Farnham Royal in the County of Buckingham, in 1936, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.
Berry was the younger brother of the industrialist Henry Berry, 1st Baron Buckland and of fellow newspaper magnate William Berry, 1st Viscount Camrose. the titles are held by his grandson, the third Viscount, who succeeded his uncle in 1999.
The Conservative politician the Hon.
Sir Anthony Berry was the youngest son of the first Viscount Kemsley.
The family seat is Church Hill Farm, near Brockenhurst, Hampshire.
The heir apparent is the present holder's son Hon.
Luke Gomer Berry (b. 1998).
William Patrick Glynn (9 July 1900 – 14 April 1978) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Collingwood in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

Rübenkamp is a station on the Hamburg-Altona link line and served by the trains of Hamburg S-Bahn lines S1 and S11.
The station is also known as Rübenkamp (City Nord), due to its proximity to City Nord.
It was opened in 1913 and is located in the Hamburg district of Barmbek-Nord, Germany.
Barmbek-Nord is part of the borough of Hamburg-Nord.
The station was opened in 1913.
The station building from this time is listed as a cultural heritage since 15 June 1986.
The lines S1 and S11 of Hamburg S-Bahn call at Rübenkamp station.
Tricking the Government is a 1914 American silent film produced by Sid Films and distributed by Warner's Features.
It was directed by Sidney Olcott with Valentine Grant and Arthur Donaldson in the leading roles.
The film was shot in Florida.
Renato Mambor (4 December 1936 – 6 December 2014) was an Italian painter, writer, photographer and actor.
Born in Rome, Mambor was a member of the 1960s artistic movement known as the Scuola di Piazza del Popolo together with Mario Schifano, Pino Pascali and Jannis Kounellis, among others.
He is considered the founder of the "Conceptual Neo-Figuration" movement (Italian: "Neofigurazione Concettuale").
His artistic interests included photography, performance art and installation art.
He was also active in cinema as a writer, a poster designer and character actor.
Kenneth Kay Kidd is an American human geneticist and emeritus professor of genetics at Yale University School of Medicine.
He is known for his work on the role of genetics in disorders such as manic depression and schizophrenia, on human genetic variation and its relationship to geography, and the Out of Africa theory of human evolution.
He also helped discover the DRD4-7R gene that has been linked to exploratory behavior.
Global cascades models are a class of models aiming to model large and rare cascades that are triggered by exogenous perturbations which are relatively small compared with the size of the system.
The phenomenon occurs ubiquitously in various systems, like information cascades in social systems, stock market crashes in economic systems, and cascading failure in physics infrastructure networks.
The models capture some essential properties of such phenomenon.
To describe and understand global cascades, a network-based threshold model has been proposed by Duncan J. Watts in 2002.
The model is motivated by considering a population of individuals who must make a decision between two alternatives, and their choices depend explicitly on other people's states or choices.
The model assumes that an individual will adopt a new particular opinion (product or state) if a threshold fraction of his/her neighbors have adopted the new one, else he would keep his original state.
To initiate the model, a new opinion will be randomly distributed among a small fraction of individuals in the network.
If the fraction satisfies a particular condition, a large cascades can be triggered. (see Global Cascades Condition) A phase transition phenomenon has been observed: when the network of interpersonal influences is sparse, the size of the cascades exhibits a power law distribution, the most highly connected nodes are critical in triggering cascades, and if the network is relatively dense, the distribution shows a bimodal form, in which nodes with average degree show more importance by serving as triggers.
Several generalizations of the Watt's threshold model have been proposed and analyzed in the following years.
For example, the original model has been combined with independent interaction models to provide a generalized model of social contagion, which classifies the behavior of the system into three universal classes.
It has also been generalized on modular networks degree-correlated networks and to networks with tunable clustering.
The role of the initiators has also been studied recently, shows that different initiator would influence the size of the cascades.
To derive the precise cascade condition in the original model, a generating function method could be applied.
The generating function for vulnerable nodes in the network is: where "p" is the probability a node has degree "k", and and "f" is the distribution of the threshold fraction of individuals.
The average vulnerable cluster size can be derived as: where "z" is the average degree of the network.
The Global cascades occur when the average vulnerable cluster size <"n"> diverges The equation could be interpreted as: When formula_5, the clusters in the network is small and global cascades will not happen since the early adopters are isolated in the system, thus no enough momentum could be generated.
When formula_6, the typical size of the vulnerable cluster is infinite, which implies presence of global cascades.
The Model considers a change of state of individuals in different systems which belongs to a larger class of contagion problems.
However it differs with other models in several aspects: Compared with 1) epidemic model: where contagion events between individual pairs are independent, the effect a single infected node having on an individual depends on the individual's other neighbors in the proposed model.
Unlike 2) percolation or self-organized criticality models, the threshold is not expressed as the absolute number of "infected" neighbors around an individual, instead, a corresponding fraction of neighbors is selected.
It is also different from 3) random-field ising model and majority voter model, which are frequently analyzed on regular lattices, here, however the heterogeneity of the network plays a significant role.
Sugishima started his career on Sunrise in the 1980s, having worked as the setting producer for "Heavy Metal L-Gaim"s episodes 1 to 18, as well as the director and storyboarder for other episodes.
Another major work in his early career was his involvement with the "Gundam" series; he directed some episodes of "Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam" and "Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ".
His first work as main director was in 1994 when he directed at Sunrise a single-episode special titled "Shinizokonai Kakarichō".
His subsequent works were not at Sunrise; he directed "Gokudo" (1999) at Trans Arts, "Yu-Gi-Oh!
Duel Monsters" (2000–2004) at Gallop, and "Speed Grapher" (2005) at Gonzo.
For the latter company he also directed the original video animation "Strike Witches" in 2007.
After directing "Nabari no Ou" at J.C.Staff in 2008, he went to direct four "Beyblade"-related television series and one film at Tatsunoko Productions and SynergySP between 2009 and 2012.
He returned to work for Sunrise where he was the director for two "Battle Spirits" anime; "Burning Soul" (2015) and "Double Drive" (2016).
Paige Marie Renkoski (born February 2, 1960) is a woman from Okemos, Michigan, who disappeared on May 24, 1990.
She was last seen talking to a man on the shoulder of Interstate 96 near Fowlerville, Michigan.
Her disappearance is one of Michigan's longest running cold cases.
At around 11:30 am on May 24, 1990, Renkoski drove her mother to Detroit Metropolitan Airport and then visited a friend in Canton, Michigan.
She was seen between 2:30 p.m. and 2:45 p.m. at a store that has since closed down, west of Interstate 275 in Canton, where she bought a beer, which was later found in her car.
The store clerk remembered seeing Renkoski because she was wearing "distinctive multi-colored, loose-fitting, flower-patterned pants and a distinctive necklace".
Renkoski was last seen on the shoulder of Interstate 96 near Fowlerville, Michigan, talking to a man who was standing next to a maroon-colored minivan.
Hours later, the 1986 Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais she had been driving was found still idling, with her shoes and purse inside.
Many people claimed to have seen Renkoski driving west on I-96.
One was a woman who said she might have seen her at a rest-stop kiosk.
Others include two long-haul semi drivers who reported seeing an attractive blond who looked like Renkoski and may have passed her when she was driving her vehicle on I-96.
Renkoski was last seen wearing a white silk shirt, with a long beaded necklace, and silk patterned slacks.
In his book "Death of a Model", which is about the death of a different young woman, investigative journalist and true crime author Clifford L. Linedecker discusses Renkowski's "baffling" disappearance, describing her as a "statuesque five foot seven inch blue-eyed blond with a model's figure."
Investigators found the 1986 silver Calais that Renkoski had been driving, but it was not processed as a crime scene because at the time it was considered by the responding officer to be an abandoned vehicle.
The car was undamaged and the door was unlocked.
The vehicle was later towed.
Someone had reported seeing Renkoski near her car at about 3:00pm, and officers had not responded to the scene until after 6:00pm.
They then had learned that Renkoski was in fact missing and the car was not abandoned.
When examining the vehicle, police found several fingerprints and palm prints, but a match has yet to be identified on any law enforcement databases.
In May 2011, authorities began searching a pond in Handy Township using ground-penetrating radar.
A woman reporting seeing a pair of cement-covered boots there around the time of Renkoski's disappearance.
In November 2011, the FBI, state and local police began a dig operation in Conway Township, Michigan, in search of Renkoski's remains.
Cadaver dogs identified the site a week before the dig started.
Investigators went to the property after reviewing a 1999 case file, which included a "hand drawn map indicating Renkoski's remains were buried there".
The police have ruled the case a homicide, even though her body has never been located and no one has been charged in her disappearance or death.
The Michigan Crime Stoppers is offering a cash reward of up to $2,500 for any information about Renkoski.
On June 27, 1990, workers began erecting billboards featuring Renkoski along Interstate 96; a total of 25 billboard ads were planned.
In May 2013, authorities announced that they would be erecting billboards featuring Renkoski and two other missing women.
On February 2, 2018, a dual memorial service was held for Renkoski and her mother, who died in December 2017.

Styraconyx is a genus of tardigrades in the family Styraconyxidae.
The genus was named and first described by Gustav Thulin in 1942.
The genus includes thirteen species:
Alexander Borisovich Lozovsky (; 23 September 1907 26 February 1981) was a Soviet Army major general.
Lozovsky served in the Red Army from the mid-1920s, initially serving as a junior officer and fighting in the Sino-Soviet conflict in 1929.
He became an armor officer in the 1930s and served at the Battles of Khalkhin Gol.
After the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941, Lozovsky became chief of staff of a tank division before becoming chief of staff of the 15th Tank Corps in mid-1942.
After the corps commander was killed in the Third Battle of Kharkov, Lozovsky temporarily took command of the corps.
He continued to serve as chief of staff of the unit when it became the 7th Guards Tank Corps, and transferred to the same position with the 10th Guards Tank Corps in 1944.
Postwar, he served as a department head in the Main Personnel Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union.

In July, Lozovsky became the corps' chief of staff, fighting in the Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh Offensive, Operation Star, and the Third Battle of Kharkov between January and March 1943.
During Operation Star, the corps suffered heavy losses in personnel and equipment and shifted to the defense after a German counterattack began the Third Battle of Kharkov.
The German counterattack cut off the corps from main forces in the Sokolovo area, and it was ordered to break out through Novaya Vodolaga.
After corps commander Major General Vasily Koptsov died on 3 March, Lozovsky took command of the corps and led the breakout in the area of Zmiiv.
Lozovsky supervised the rebuilding of the corps during the next months, while simultaneously being both corps commander and chief of staff.
On 11 June, Major General Filipp Rudkin arrived to take command of the corps, and Lozovsky reverted to being the chief of staff.

Pleasures of the Harbor is Phil Ochs' fourth full-length album and his first for A&M Records, released in 1967.
It is one of Ochs's most somber albums.
In stark contrast to his three albums for Elektra Records which had all been folk music, "Pleasures of the Harbor" featured traces of classical, rock and roll, Dixieland jazz and experimental synthesized music crossing with folk, in hopes of producing a "folk-pop" crossover.
The best known track is "Outside of a Small Circle of Friends", a sarcastic jab at the apathetic nature of people in certain situations, at its base the story of the Murder of Kitty Genovese in New York City (which numerous people witnessed, doing nothing to help), set to a Dixieland backing.
The mention of marijuana in one verse was misinterpreted, and its release as a single failed to do anything on the charts as it was banned from radio play by many stations. "The Party" savaged high-class snobs, with Ochs taking the role of a lounge pianist, observing the ridiculous nature of their gatherings.
"Flower Lady" was a six-minute narrative about contrasting characters in the city, with each anecdote having one thing in common; everyone ignores the poor woman trying to sell her flowers. "Pleasures of the Harbor", the title track, is a dirge to lonely sailors seeking human comfort and connection while in port.
Ochs composed it after watching a screening of John Ford's 1940 film "The Long Voyage Home", which starred one of Ochs' movie idols, John Wayne.
It features a lilting melodic line and what some consider to be an overblown film score-like orchestration (supposedly including a young Warren Zevon), a view which Ochs himself would later on come to share.
This recording of "The Crucifixion", which closed the album, was deemed a failed experiment by Ochs, as far as its avant-garde production experiment (by Joseph Byrd) is concerned.
Lyrically and musically, however, many consider the song to be Ochs' masterpiece.
Its ten verses compare John F. Kennedy and Christ, and explore the "cycle of sacrifice" where we build up our leaders into heroes so that we can enjoy tearing them down.
The song is said to have brought Kennedy's brother Robert to tears when Ochs performed it for him a cappella in early 1968, months before the younger Kennedy's own assassination.
All live versions of the song performed in concert featured Ochs alone, with just his guitar and voice, and one of those live performances is on the posthumously released compilations "Chords of Fame" and "Farewells & Fantasies".
All songs by Phil Ochs.

TS "Queen Mary" is a retired Clyde steamer launched in 1933 and now being preserved as a museum ship.
She was built at the William Denny shipyard at Dumbarton for Williamson-Buchanan Steamers.
The 871 gross registered ton steamer was powered by three direct drive steam turbines, and carried 2,086 passengers making her the largest (though not the longest) excursion turbine on the River Clyde.
In 1933 she joined the Williamson-Buchanan fleet, taking over from the first Clyde turbine steamer, the 1901 TS "King Edward" on the run from Glasgow down the River and Firth of Clyde to Rothesay, Millport and Arran.
In 1935 the fleet including "Queen Mary" passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company, and her registered owners became Williamson-Buchanan (1936) Ltd. Also in 1935, Williamson-Buchanan were contacted by the Cunard company which was getting ready to have its new liner launched by Her Majesty Queen Mary – so Cunard reached agreement with Williamson-Buchanan that the turbine steamer would become TS "Queen Mary II", and presented a portrait of Her Majesty to hang in the forward lounge of the Clyde steamer, while their liner became the RMS "Queen Mary". "Queen Mary II" was a roomy and comfortable ship, well suited to the large numbers of passengers on the route, with passenger capacity making up for a modest speed of 19.7 knots on trial.
She was a two class ship, with cabin passengers housed forward and the top deck extending aft giving steerage passengers a share of it as well as sheltered space below.
Though the rest of the fleet was painted in the LMS livery with yellow funnels, she retained her white funnels and Williamson-Buchanan house-flag until World War II.
During the war, she worked on maintaining Clyde services while many other steamers became minesweepers or anti-aircraft vessels.
After the war, she returned to service in LMS livery with yellow funnels; then, post war 1948 nationalisation of the railways brought the steamers under the Caledonian Steam Packet Company (CSP) with the same livery.
As traffic increased in the 1950s, modifications were made.
Over the winter of 1956-1957 the TS "Queen Mary II" was changed from coal to oil burning, the two funnels were replaced by a single funnel and a new mainmast was added so that she now had two masts to meet changed regulations for ship's lights, with her tonnage increasing to 1014.
In the 1960s, a gradual change in holiday habits and a succession of summers with poor weather led to a decline in Clyde sailings.
While other ships were retired, the "Queen Mary II" was refitted and put on cruises from Gourock to Inveraray, Brodick and Campbeltown.
The CSP had been gradually merging with the west highland ferry company MacBraynes, and in 1973 the company became Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd. After a disappointing first season, they decided to reduce their fleet, with the paddle steamer "Waverley" being handed to a preservation society, and its routes taken over by the "Queen Mary" (which lost the ""II"" as the Cunard liner had by then been retired). "Waverley" survived and prospered, but with the shift to diesel car ferries and cost pressures the "Queen Mary" was retired after a last evening showboat cruise from Largs to Rothesay on 27 September 1977.
She was then laid up in the East India Harbour, Greenock.
In 1981 the ship was bought by the Lau family and taken south to London to become a floating restaurant but unfortunately it did not do well until 1987 when it was sold to Bass PLC.
She underwent a £2.5m refurbishment in 1997 and was moored at Victoria Embankment.
Facilities included two bars and two function rooms and the top deck of the ship was used as an open-air venue with bar facilities.
In November 2009, the ship was towed out of London.
She was purchased by Samuel Boudon who had plans for her renovation and mooring in La Rochelle, France as a floating restaurant and fitness centre.
However, she remained moored in Tilbury Docks.
She was auctioned by Capital Marine Services on 24 August 2011, and sold to a British antique dealer planning to restore her to 1930s glory; ″"Queen Mary" is the last survivor of her class anywhere in the world and is an exceptionally important part of British maritime history epitomising the very best of British shipbuilding pedigree and tradition", ″Our mission is to restore this unique example of British Maritime History″.
In 2012 a charitable group, "Friends of the TS Queen Mary", was formed with the goal of returning the ship to a permanent berth in Glasgow, Scotland.
In 2013 the ship's owner, Ranjan Chowdhury, was criticised in the media for attempting to sell the ship's remaining brass propellor.
By February 2015 "Queen Mary" was prevented by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency from leaving the Port of Tilbury until made seaworthy.
In October 2015 the Glasgow-based charity "Friends of TS Queen Mary" purchased the ship.
In May 2016, after being made seaworthy, the "Queen Mary" was towed from Tilbury to Greenock.
The ship's return to the Firth of Clyde on 16 May 2016 was her first visit to her former home since 1981. "Queen Mary" was berthed in James Watt Dock throughout the summer of 2016.
On 1 September 2016, following a successful campaign to raise money to repair and repaint the ship's hull, "Queen Mary" was towed into the adjacent Garvel Drydock.
A complete repaint of the hull, and structural repairs were made to the ship throughout the course of a month.
On 1 October 2016 "Queen Mary" returned to James Watt Dock.
The ship's funnels were repainted white in October, and on 9 November 2016 "Queen Mary" left James Watt Dock under tow for Glasgow on what would be her first visit to the city since 1977.
The ship is now berthed at the entrance of Princes' Dock beside the Glasgow Science Centre.
HD 83443 is an orange dwarf star approximately 134 light-years away in the constellation of Vela.
As of 2000, at least one extrasolar planet has been confirmed to be orbiting the star.
The planet HD 83443 b was discovered in 2000 by the Geneva Extrasolar Planet Search Team led by Michel Mayor.
It has a minimum mass comparable to Saturn's, and its orbit at the time of discovery was one of the shortest known taking only three days to complete one revolution around the star.
This hot Jupiter is likely to be slightly larger than Jupiter in radius.
In 2000, the same year that planet b was found, another planet around HD 83443 was announced by the Geneva Team.
The new planet was designated as "HD 83443 c".
It had a mass smaller than planet b and a short, very eccentric orbit.
Its orbital period, 28.9 days, was especially interesting, because it indicated a 10:1 orbital resonance between the planets.
However, a team led by astronomer Paul Butler did not detect any signal indicating the existence of the second planet.
New observations by the Geneva team could not detect the signal either and the discovery claim had to be retracted.
The origin of the signal, which was "highly significant" in the earlier data is not yet clear.

Ricardo Migliorisi is a Paraguayan painter, costume designer, scenery designer and architect.
Winner of national and international awards.
He exposed his work in many countries in America and Europe.
Ricardo was born in Asunción, Paraguay, on January 6, 1948 to Isolina Salsa Ferraris and Salvador Migliorisi Tumino, of Italian origin.
He did his elementary studies at the Dante Aliglieri School and later on, at San José School, in Asunción.
His liking for the aesthetics and art were manifested at a young age and has made to mature the soul of this artist.
His first artistic expressions came up when he was eighteen years old.
When young, studied Plastic Arts in the Cira Moscarda Studio.
In that studio many young people could give free hand to their creativity, expressed with inedited elements.
The experience he lived there, gives him the impulse to come out as a transgressor in all his work.
Ricardo also studied engraving with the expert Livio Abramo, but basically he can be considered autodidactic.
Later on, he studied Architecture in the Universidad Nacional de Asunción (National University of Asuncion).
In the following years of his formation as an artist he gained much experience in many Latin-American countries, working as a wardrobe and scenery designer.
In the beginning he used drawing and painting in most of his work, but later included different other types of elements to his creations.
In a short period of time, the young artist showed the world an innovator, psychedelic and delirious style in his work.
Ricardo Migliorisi appears in the Paraguayan artistic society in the mid ‘60s, a time marked by the urgent actualization and opening, by the emerging novelty in the field of Modernism, that invaded all the artistic societies in America and Europe.
He has had numerous opportunities to show his work: Also, collective expositions with contemporary artists: During his career he received many awards.
His artistic production traveled numerous exposition rooms.
Some of them are: A very particular style, with an ample variety of expressive resources, paintings, montages, audio-visual experiences and installations are part of his work.
His characters are considered none too realistic, and may represent popular Latin-American subjects, animals and classic mythology, opera, circus and cabaret characters, the television and socialite, all of them with crazy tendencies.
Migliorisi presents a strong scenic sense, binding his creations to theatrical spaces.
In his characters there is the mystery of the masks and the shine of footlight.
The way he uses the color is a remarkable characteristic, the contrast, transparencies and textures give live to mud or metal objects.
Emerge imposing plaster figures, woods of feather, glass pearls and golden stones and caracoles.
Descendent of Italians, his family lives in Asunción.
He has a sister: María Cristina Migliorisi de Galiano. - Wikipedia
Centigrade 232 is an album and a book of poems by English writer and musician Robert Calvert, recorded in 1986 and released in 2007.
The poem Centigrade 232 was set to music by Spirits Burning in 2001.
Some titles were set to music by Hawkwind and issued as "The Brock/Calvert Project" in 2007.
Calvert had regarded himself first and foremost as a poet and writer and his original involvement with the English rock group Hawkwind from 1971 was as a lyricist and narrator of "space-age poetry" at gigs.
It was later as a solo performer and his second spell with Hawkwind from 1976 that he had become more recognised as being a singer and front-man of a rock band, but he continued actively writing poems and plays during this time.
In 1977 a collection of his poems were compiled and published by Quasar books, the title being (allegedly) the temperature at which writing paper burns "signifying the writer destroying his rough drafts".
This is an allusion to the Ray Bradbury novel "Fahrenheit 451" and possibly the film thereof, 451°F being equivalent to 232 Centigrade.
Some of the poems are pieces he had performed with Hawkwind during the "Space Ritual" show, such as "The First Landing on Medusa" which was performed as "The Awakening".
Others would be adapted into Hawkwind songs, such as "The Starfarer's Despatch" and "The Clone's Poem" which were combined into "Spirit of the Age".
The poem "Circle Line" won the Capital Radio Poetry Award in 1975.
The book received a launch party at Battersea Arts Centre, London, which also featured performances from Cream lyricist Pete Brown and Gong's Daevid Allen and Gilli Smyth.
In 1986 Calvert started issuing cassette tapes of his work under the imprint of Harbour Publications.
One of these tapes was the full recitation of the "Centigrade 232" collection.
Other releases comprised recitations of the unpublished "Earth Ritual" poems collection and two music tapes, "Blueprints from the Cellar" Volumes 1 and 2, which contained home demos of songs, some of which would be released in completed form on the albums "Freq" and "Test Tube Conceived".
Calvert's "Centigrade 232" tape recitation was first used with music on the second Spirits Burning album "Reflections in a Radio Shower", released in 2001.
Don Falcone took the original recording of Calvert reading his poem "Centigrade 232" and integrated it into the track "Drive-By Poetry".
Lines from another Centigrade 232 poem ("Ode To A Crystal Set") appear on the CD's opening track "Second Degree Soul Sparks".
In October 2007, Voiceprint Records re-issued "Centigrade 232" in a package containing both a reprint of the 1977 book and a CD of the 1986 recitations.
Voiceprint Records label head Rob Ayling passed a copy of the cassette tape of Calvert's recitations to Dave Brock and asked him to set some of the titles to music.
The music was played by the then current line-up of Hawkwind, but some titles were lost at the mixing stage delaying the release until August 2007.
The release was credited to the Brock/Calvert Project.
All titles by Robert Calvert Calvert appears on two tracks on the CD Reflections In a Radio Shower.
All words by the vocalists and lyricists on the track.
All music by all personnel on the track.
All words by Robert Calvert.
All music by Dave Brock, except 9 and 11 by Brock and Jason Stuart
Immortality is a popular subject in fiction, as it explores humanity's deep-seated fears and comprehension of its own mortality.
Immortal beings and species abound in fiction, especially fantasy fiction, and the meaning of "immortal" tends to vary.
Some fictional beings are completely immortal (or very nearly so) in that they are immune to death by injury, disease and age.
Sometimes such powerful immortals can only be killed by each other, as is the case with the Q from the "Star Trek" series.
Even if something can't be killed, a common plot device involves putting an immortal being into a slumber or limbo, as is done with Morgoth in J. R. R. Tolkien's "The Silmarillion" and the Dreaming God of "Pathways Into Darkness".
Storytellers often make it a point to give weaknesses to even the most indestructible of beings.
For instance, Superman is supposed to be invulnerable, yet his enemies were able to exploit his now-infamous weakness: Kryptonite. (See also Achilles' heel.)
Many fictitious species are said to be immortal if they cannot die of old age, even though they can be killed through other means, such as injury.
Modern fantasy elves often exhibit this form of immortality.
Other creatures, such as vampires and the immortals in the film "Highlander", can only die from beheading.
The classic and stereotypical vampire is typically slain by one of several very specific means, including a silver bullet (or piercing with other silver weapons), a stake through the heart (perhaps made of consecrated wood), or by exposing them to sunlight.
Mythological beings are often used in modern fiction as characters, as a plot device, or even just as "window dressing".
Such beings are often either immortal or associated with immortality.
Tezuka Osamu's lifework "Phoenix" (known in Japan as "Hi no Tori") had a phoenix whose blood would provide immortality.
In various ages, many "heroes" and "heroines" would strive for immortality only to realize that there is something beyond eternal life.
In one story titled "Rose Ham" (lit. "Next World Story") the last remaining human male who survived a holocaust, blessed (or cursed) with immortality through the phoenix blood, would create another beginning of life.
In his immortal form, he would see a race of slugs, after gaining intelligence, destroy themselves in another holocaust.
He would seed the earth with life that would become present day humans, and finally leave the earth to join his lover, who died billions of years ago, in heaven.
In the Cthulhu Mythos created by H. P. Lovecraft, there is a race of "Fish-Men" known as Deep Ones.
They stop aging after reaching adulthood and can breed with humans to birth offspring with this "eternal youth."
This is a faustian bargain, as after reaching the age of 20, the Deep One Hybrids undergo a transformation from normal humans into Deep Ones.
They also lose all concept of humanity and morality and go to live in the ocean with the Deep Ones and to worship the undersea deity Father Dagon, the Ruler of the Deep Ones and consort to Mother Hydra.
Since immortality is seen as a desire of humanity, themes involving immortality often explore the disadvantages as well as the advantages of such a trait.
Sometimes immortality is used as a punishment, or a curse that might be intended to teach a lesson.
It is not uncommon to find immortal characters yearning for death.
In some parts of popular culture, immortality is not all that it is made out to be, possibly causing insanity and/or significant emotional pain.
Much of the time, these things only happen to mortals who gain immortality.
Beings born with immortality (such as deities, demigods and races with "limited immortality") are usually quite adjusted to their long lives, though some may feel sorrow at the passing of mortal friends, but they still continue on.
Some immortals may also watch over mortal relations (either related to or descended from them), occasionally offering help when needed.
In legend, most famously in Wagner's opera "The Flying Dutchman", a ship's captain is cursed with immortality after attempting to sail around the Cape of Good Hope in a terrible storm.
He is doomed to sail around the Cape forever.
In Jonathan Swift's "Gulliver's Travels", some of the inhabitants of the island of Immortals (near Japan) don't die, but they age and become ill, demented, and a nuisance to themselves and those surrounding them.
Swift presents immortality as a curse rather than a blessing.
In general, a theme seen with many variations, is the notion of an essential world weariness akin to extreme exhaustion for which death is the only relief.
This is inescapable when immortality is defined as (half) infinite life.
Immortality defined as finite but arbitrarily long per the desire to exist does not, as a definition, suffer this limitation.
When a person is tired of life, even death is shut off to them, creating an endless torture.
The undead are fictional people who have died and still maintain some aspects of life.
In many examples, the undead are immune to aging or even heal at an accelerated rate.
Dracula is one of the most famous examples of the undead.
Immortality can be achieved in fiction through scientifically plausible means.
Extraterrestrial life might be immortal or it might be able to give immortality to humans.
Immortality is also achieved in many examples by replacing the mortal human body by machines.
There are many examples of immortality in fiction where a character is vulnerable to death and injury in the normal way but possesses an extraordinary capacity for recovery.
The long-running British science-fiction series "Doctor Who" focuses on a character called the Doctor, a member of the alien Time Lord race, who can "regenerate" instead of dying or aging; however, rather than simply healing wounds, this results in his entire physical appearance changing when he is fatally wounded or terminally sick, and he is only capable of doing so twelve times before finally dying for good.
There are numerous works of fantasy fiction dealing with spiritual immortality in the form of reincarnation or a world of the dead.
The list is in chronological order for the first appearance of the fictitious character.
As noted above, specific characters who as a class tend to be immortal such as vampires and robots are not listed individually.
Lists of classes who as a group tend to be possibly immortal include:
Oscar Edward "Hub" Knolls (December 18, 1883 – July 1, 1946) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball.
He pitched in two games for the 1906 Brooklyn Superbas.

Nérignac is a commune in the Vienne department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region in western France.
The Standard Bearer of England was once an important office within the English army, especially during the times when Kings were still present on the battlefield.
As standard-bearer Henry de Essex was greatly chastised when he threw down the English Standard and claimed his King was dead in 1153.
During the Wars of the Roses, each side had their own standard bearer, such as Sir David Ap Mathew, standard bearer of King Edward IV, and William Brandon, standard bearer of Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond at the Battle of Bosworth.
During the English Civil War, Charles II's standard bearer was not called Standard Bearer of England as he was only proclaimed King in 1661 long after the civil war had ended.
It increasingly became an honorific rank, and in modern times it has been linked with the Queen's Champion.
Nuclear transport factor 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "NUTF2" gene.
The protein encoded by this gene is a cytosolic factor that facilitates protein transport into the nucleus.
It interacts with the nuclear pore complex glycoprotein p62.
This encoded protein acts at a relative late stage of nuclear protein import, subsequent to the initial docking of nuclear import ligand at the nuclear envelope.
It is thought to be part of a multicomponent system of cytosolic factors that assemble at the pore complex during nuclear import.
NUTF2 has been shown to interact with Nucleoporin 62{ and RAN.
Osina Mała is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Ziębice, within Ząbkowice Śląskie County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland.

The peak's summit is a designated natural park known as the "Parque Natural de Peñalara", which features several small lakes and some steep escarpments.
The outline of Peñalara is rounded, displaying few underhangs.
The hillsides of this mountain are covered with different types of vegetation, depending on the elevation.
Largely undisturbed oak tree groves are found at an elevation of 1,000 to 1,300 metres.
From 1,100 metres to 2,000 metres, the slopes are dominated by wild pine forests.
From 2,000 metres up to the summit, the vegetation consists of more sparsely distributed, low-lying bushes particular to high elevations.
The animal habitation of the mountain is made up of small mammals, a large variety of insects and various bird species such as eagles and vultures.

The Best of Nelly Furtado is the first greatest hits album by Canadian singer-songwriter Nelly Furtado.
The album was first released on 12 November 2010.
The album includes all of Furtado's biggest hits, as well as songs she's featured in and three new songs: "Night Is Young", "Stars" and "Girlfriend in the City".
The album is available in Standard, Deluxe and Super Deluxe Editions.
The album's track listing and artwork were revealed on 14 October 2010.
Talking about how she picked the new songs to be on the greatest hits Furtado said, "The way I picked the new songs for Best of Nelly Furtado was I was just coming off my Latin American tour for "Mi Plan" and two of my songs got leaked on the internet.
Somebody in Eastern Europe or something leaked the songs on the internet.
One song was "Night Is Young" and the other song was "Girlfriend In The City", but they were kind of horrible versions that weren’t even finished and not mixed.
So I thought okay, a lot of my fans have heard these new songs anyway in their rough version, I might as well finish them and put them out properly on the greatest hits album.
It kind of seemed like the natural choice.
And then the third selection is "Stars", which is a song Lester Mendez and I wrote a couple years ago when we were doing the "Loose" sessions.
It’s one of those songs that I think people who like "Folklore" will like, because it’s more intimate and slow."
The diss track "Give It to Me" was omitted from the album's track listing due to the negative lyrical content according to Furtado in an interview.
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album a four out of five star rating, noting the variety on the album and commended that "Not one of Nelly Furtado’s albums sounds like the one that came before", calling it an "admirable trait".
Slant Magazine called Furtado "one of pop music's most eclectic artists" and wrote that "the set also positions Furtado as one of the absolute finest singles artists of her generation."
Scott Kara from "The New Zealand Herald" saw the release as being for the fans.
On 26 August 2010 at the "Orange Warsaw Festival" in Poland, Furtado debuted two previously unreleased songs, "Night Is Young" and "Girlfriend in the City" The album charted on the Austrian Albums Chart, Italian Albums Chart, German Albums Chart and UK Albums Chart for solely one week, while lasting two on the Swiss Albums Chart, debuting at 100 and peaking at 29.
The album failed to chart on any of the United States charts, however sold moderately in Canada peaking at 57.

Described by Le Guin as a retrospective, it collects 17 previously published stories, four of which were the germ of novels she was to write later: "The Word of Unbinding" and "The Rule of Names" gave Le Guin the place that was to become Earthsea; "Semley's Necklace" was first published as "Dowry of the Angyar" in 1964 and then as the Prologue of the novel "Rocannon's World" in 1966; "Winter's King" is about the inhabitants of the planet Winter, as is Le Guin's later novel "The Left Hand of Darkness".
Most of the other stories are also connected to Le Guin's novels.
The story "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" won the Hugo Award in 1974, while "The Day Before the Revolution" won the Locus and Nebula Awards in 1975.

In physics, a quantum phase transition (QPT) is a phase transition between different quantum phases (phases of matter at zero temperature).
Contrary to classical phase transitions, quantum phase transitions can only be accessed by varying a physical parameter—such as magnetic field or pressure—at absolute zero temperature.
The transition describes an abrupt change in the ground state of a many-body system due to its quantum fluctuations.
Such a quantum phase transition can be a second-order phase transition.
To understand quantum phase transitions, it is useful to contrast them to classical phase transitions (CPT) (also called thermal phase transitions).
A CPT describes a cusp in the thermodynamic properties of a system.
It signals a reorganization of the particles; A typical example is the freezing transition of water describing the transition between liquid and solid.
The classical phase transitions are driven by a competition between the energy of a system and the entropy of its thermal fluctuations.
A classical system does not have entropy at zero temperature and therefore no phase transition can occur.
Their order is determined by the first discontinuous derivative of a thermodynamic potential.
A phase transition from water to ice, for example, involves latent heat (a discontinuity of the internal energy formula_1) and is of first order.
A phase transition from a ferromagnet to a paramagnet is continuous and is of second order. (See phase transition for Ehrenfest's classification of phase transitions by the derivative of free energy which is discontinuous at the transition).
These continuous transitions from an ordered to a disordered phase are described by an order parameter, which is zero in the disordered and nonzero in the ordered phase.
For the aforementioned ferromagnetic transition, the order parameter would represent the total magnetization of the system.
Although the thermodynamic average of the order parameter is zero in the disordered state, its fluctuations can be nonzero and become long-ranged in the vicinity of the critical point, where their typical length scale "ξ" (correlation length) and typical fluctuation decay time scale "τ" (correlation time) diverge: where is defined as the relative deviation from the critical temperature "T".
We call "ν" the (correlation length) "critical exponent" and "z" the "dynamical critical exponent".
Critical behavior of nonzero temperature phase transitions is fully described by classical thermodynamics; quantum mechanics does not play any role even if the actual phases require a quantum mechanical description (e.g. superconductivity).
Talking about "quantum" phase transitions means talking about transitions at "T" = 0: by tuning a non-temperature parameter like pressure, chemical composition or magnetic field, one could suppress e.g. some transition temperature like the Curie or Néel temperature to 0 K. As a system in equilibrium at zero temperature is always in its lowest-energy state, a QPT cannot be explained by thermal fluctuations.
Instead, quantum fluctuations, arising from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, drive the loss of order characteristic of a QPT.
The QPT occurs at the quantum critical point (QCP), where quantum fluctuations driving the transition diverge and become scale invariant in space and time.
Although absolute zero is not physically realizable, characteristics of the transition can be detected in the system's low-temperature behavior near the critical point.
At nonzero temperatures, classical fluctuations with an energy scale of "kT" compete with the quantum fluctuations of energy scale "ħω."
Here "ω" is the characteristic frequency of the quantum oscillation and is inversely proportional to the correlation time.
Quantum fluctuations dominate the system's behavior in the region where "ħω" > "kT", known as the quantum critical region.
This quantum critical behavior manifests itself in unconventional and unexpected physical behavior like novel non Fermi liquid phases.
From a theoretical point of view, a phase diagram like the one shown on the right is expected: the QPT separates an ordered from a disordered phase (often, the low temperature disordered phase is referred to as 'quantum' disordered).
At high enough temperatures, the system is disordered and purely classical.
Around the classical phase transition, the system is governed by classical thermal fluctuations (light blue area).
This region becomes narrower with decreasing energies and converges towards the quantum critical point (QCP).
Experimentally, the 'quantum critical' phase, which is still governed by quantum fluctuations, is the most interesting one.
Fiesta, often called Fiestaware, is a line of ceramic glazed dinnerware manufactured and marketed by the Homer Laughlin China Company of Newell, West Virginia since its introduction in 1936, with a hiatus from 1973 to 1985.
Fiesta is noted for its Art Deco styling featuring concentric circles—and its range of solid colors.
Both Fiesta's original shapes and its glazes were designed by Frederick Hurten Rhead, Homer Laughlin's art director.
Several of the original shapes were redesigned (and other new shapes added) by Jonathan O. Parry, who became Homer Laughlin's art director in 1984.
When the Fiesta line was re-introduced in 1986, it featured a more durable, vitreous composition.
Fiesta is sold in sets or from "open stock" where customers can select by the piece, mixing and matching from the entire color range.
According to the Smithsonian Institution Press, Fiesta's appeal lies in its colors, design, and affordability.
In 2002, "The New York Times" called Fiesta "the most collected brand of china in the United States".
Fiesta was introduced at the annual Pottery and Glass Exhibit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in January 1936.
It was not the first solid color dinnerware in the US; smaller companies, especially Bauer Pottery in California, had been producing dinnerware, vases, and garden pottery, in solid color glazes for the better part of a decade by the time Fiesta was introduced to the market.
However, Fiesta was the first widely mass-promoted and marketed solid-color dinnerware in the US.
When it was introduced, the decoration of dinnerware and kitchenware ceramics was still inspired by the Victorian era, based on full, predetermined sets of dinnerware, all decorated with the same decal designs.
With its solid color glazes and mix-and-match concept, Fiesta represented something radically new to the general public.
The forms and surfaces expressed an Art Deco influence.
At introduction, the Fiesta line of dinnerware comprised some 37 different pieces, including such occasional pieces as candle holders in two designs, a bud vase, and an ash tray.
A set of seven nested mixing bowls ranged in size, from the smallest at five inches in diameter up to a nearly twelve-inch diameter.
The company sold basic table service sets for four, six and eight persons, made up of the usual dinner plate, salad plate, soup bowl, and cup and saucer.
But, the promotion and presentation of Fiesta from the start was as a line of open-stock items from which the individual purchaser could choose to combine serving and place pieces by personal preference and need.
As an early Homer Laughlin Company brochure said: "COLOR! that's the trend today ..." and it went on to say, "It gives the hostess the opportunity to create her own table effects ... Plates of one color, Cream Soups of another, contrasting Cups and Saucers ... it's FUN to set a table with Fiesta!"
The Homer Laughlin Company quickly added several additional items to the line.
During this period some items were modified, and several items were eliminated, including the covered onion soup bowl, and the mixing bowl covers.
In the years up to 1940, the line was expanded by the production of more new items.
At its most numerous, the Fiesta line comprised approximately 64 different items, including flower vases in three sizes, divided plates, water tumblers, carafes, teapots in two sizes, five part relish trays, and large chop plates in fifteen-inch and thirteen-inch diameters.
In addition, it offered several unique promotional items for one dollar each, available only in a predetermined glaze color.
With World War II and the need for manufacturers to focus on production for that effort, non-war related production and public demand declined.
Beginning in 1942, the Fiesta line of items began to be reduced.
Over the next four years, the more unusual serving pieces were being discontinued, and by 1946, the line's variety of items had been reduced by nearly one third.
Overall sales of the more typical place-setting pieces of Fiesta remained strong and reportedly peaked around 1948.
The popularity of Fiesta was due to its bright colors, durable construction, stylized art deco shapes and designs, and its promotion through mass marketing.
From its first introduction in 1936 and for over a decade, Fiesta products were a widespread fad.
The dinnerware became something of a status symbol for late 1930s and pre-war 1940s middle-class households.
Today, vintage Fiesta trades briskly on auction websites and at other antique/vintage product sales venues.
The line name and design is still owned by the Homer Laughlin China Company of Newell, West Virginia, which was the original company that produced and marketed it.
Except for minor adjustments due to manufacturing requirements, the design of the original shapes remained virtually unchanged from 1936 to 1969.
As home decorating color styles changed, the company changed the solid color glazes.
The texture of the original glazes, and throughout the life of vintage Fiesta, was semi-opaque.
This is smooth and glossy, but without any shining glare, rather more like an eggshell.
The ware sometimes shows " glaze curtains", areas of uneven glazing where a heavy application meets a lighter one.
At its introduction in 1936, Fiesta was produced in five colors: Red (orange red), Blue (cobalt), Green (light green), Yellow (deep golden), and Old Ivory (yellowish cream).
By 1938, two years into production, a sixth color was added: Turquoise (robin's egg blue).
With the exception of the Red, this color assortment remained in production until approximately 1950.
The original Red had been discontinued before 1944 (see below).
The discontinuation of red, plus the general changes in society due to the United States' participation in World War II, caused a slump in sales of the larger serving pieces from the early 1940s.
Prior to this reduction in the number of shapes offered, only one or two very specialized shapes had been discontinued and those by 1938.
These early discontinued items, such as covered onion soup bowls in turquoise glaze and mixing bowl covers in any color, are today quite rare.
By 1950, home decorating styles and colors had changed.
The Homer Laughlin Company discontinued some original glaze colors and replaced them with four new colors.
The original Blue (cobalt), the original Green (light green), and the original Old Ivory (yellowish cream) were discontinued, replaced by Rose (dark pink), Gray (medium), Forest (dark green), and Chartreuse (bright yellowish green).
Two existing glaze colors, Yellow and Turquoise, were retained, allowing the company to offer six colors through the 1950s.
By the end of the 1950s, sales had again dropped.
The company reduced its offering of items and changed the glaze colors.
By 1959 the United States government had released its block on uranium, which enabled the Homer Laughlin Company to produce the original bright orange-red glaze again (see below).
The company discontinued the four new glazes of the previous decade in favor of a new green color and the re-introduced original bright orange-red color, which along with the yellow and turquoise colors made up the four glaze colors offered from 1959 through 1969.
Although the company always referred to the new color simply as Green in its brochures, collectors later called it Medium Green, to distinguish it from other green glazes which the company had produced.
The Medium Green is a bright, almost Kelly green.
Some have described it as a "John Deere Tractor" green.
Beginning in 1959, Fiesta was available in the following colors: Red (original orange red), Green (new Medium green), Yellow (original golden), and Turquoise (original robin's egg blue).
Although this color assortment was available and sold for ten years (1959–1969), the popularity of Fiesta had fallen.
The newest shade of green is in very short supply on the secondary market relative to the other glaze colors.
It has gained almost mythical status and, for certain pieces in this glaze, commands astronomical prices wholly disproportionate to the rest of the line.
The Yellow glaze is the one glaze that was in production throughout the life of vintage Fiesta.
Turquoise, while not strictly an original color (having been introduced about a year into Fiesta's production) was otherwise also in continuous production until the end of the original vintage era in 1969.
Red, while an original color at the line's introduction, was removed from the market before 1944 (see below).
Although it was brought back into production from 1959 to 1969, this was after most of the unusual serving pieces had long been discontinued.
Red pieces also usually command a premium price in the secondary market, both for its vibrancy in the mix of colors and for its scarcity due to limited years of production.
While many collectors love all the colors, some only want those of the "Original 6" or "Fifties Colors".
Brilliant red Fiesta (and indeed the red glazes produced by all U.S. potteries of the era) is known for having a detectable amount of uranium oxide in its glaze, which produced the orange-red color.
During World War II, the government took control of uranium for development of the atom bomb, and confiscated the company's stocks.
Homer Laughlin discontinued Fiesta red in 1944.
The company reintroduced Fiesta red in 1959 using depleted uranium (rather than the original natural uranium), after the Atomic Energy Commission relaxed its restrictions on uranium oxide.
In addition to pottery glazing, Uranium oxide was used even more extensively in the tiling industry, producing Uranium tile.
Red is not the only color of vintage ceramic glaze that is radioactive; it is detectable from other colors, including ivory.
The level of radioactivity of vintage fiestaware has been published and is available online.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency warns consumers not to use radioactive glazed ceramics for food or drink use.
Others recommend against using such pieces for food storage due to the possibility of leaching of uranium or other heavy metals (often present in some colored glazes) into food, especially acidic foods.
On March 16, 2011, the Homer Laughlin Company posted this statement on its website, in response to a "Good Morning America" broadcast about radioactivity in the home: By 1969 home decorating tastes had again changed.
The company restyled the shapes of Fiesta to try to modernize it.
Finials on covers, handles on cups, bowl contours and shapes, were all modified to give Fiesta a more contemporary appearance.
The glaze colors were also changed, with the choices being limited to three colors for the place-setting pieces, and one color for the five major serving pieces.
These were the remainder of the 64-piece assortment of shapes.
Although essentially the same Red glaze as had then been available since 1959, it was renamed Mango Red.
Replacing Yellow, Turquoise, and Medium Green, were two new glaze colors.
One was Turf Green, which nearly matched the popular Avocado color of the day.
The second color was Antique Gold, a brownish-yellow which nearly matched the popular Harvest Gold of the era.
The line's name was changed to "Fiesta Ironstone".
The shape redesigns and color changes did not restore Fiesta's popularity, and in January 1973 the company discontinued the Fiesta line.
As is common with many dinnerware shapes, the manufacturers add different decals to the shapes and give them new names.
Throughout its long life (1936–1973), the item shapes of Fiesta were often decorated with decals and marketed under other names, or a name variation.
One example was "Fiesta Casuals", which consisted of two patterns, one with yellow and brown florals and accented with solid color Fiesta yellow items, the other with turquoise and brown florals and accented with solid color Fiesta turquoise items.
As another example, in the late 1960s, the shapes of Fiesta were glazed in a dark 'bean-pot' brown, flat pieces were given an underglaze 'Mediterranean-style' geometric decal in black, and the line was marketed as "Amberstone" in a supermarket promotion.
Later these shapes were glazed in Antique Gold, with a different stylized pattern under the glaze.
This line was dubbed "Casualstone" for another supermarket promotion.
During the 1970s, a new appreciation for Art Deco designs from the 1920s and 1930s flourished.
Along with this, the baby boomers were establishing their own households.
They made Fiesta popular once again.
Almost immediately after Fiesta was discontinued in January 1973, collectors began buying heavily in second-hand shops and the newly popular garage sales.
Another avenue for acquiring pieces, and sometimes entire collections, was through local auctions.
Due to the enormous popularity of Fiesta in the secondary market, its prices skyrocketed.
By the end of the 1970s and into the 1980s, Fiesta items once costing pennies were commanding nearly a hundred U.S. dollars for scarcer items.
By the mid-1980s, prices had climbed higher.
Certain pieces and colors were being traded for hundreds of dollars.
The Homer Laughlin China Company noticed the activity on the secondary market.
After a production lapse of 13 years, in 1986 the company marked the 50th anniversary of Fiesta by its reintroduction.
Prior to mass production and promotion, Laughlin used the original semi-vitreous clay body on shapes taken mostly from the last incarnation of vintage Fiesta (1969–1973).
The company then changed the body to a fully vitrified clay, to enable marketing to the restaurant and service industry, as this clay was more durable.
Many original shapes required a redesign because of shrinkage associated with the new clay.
Although old and new runs appear similar, direct comparison demonstrates the newer pieces (made with the fully vitrified clay body) are noticeably smaller.
In addition to redesigns, new shapes were added to the line.
In 1986, Laughlin offered five colors: The glaze texture on this new Fiesta is very smooth, hard and much shinier than the original Fiesta.
Since its introduction, new Fiesta has remained popular.
In addition, it has increased collector interest in all the lines.
Many people are collecting vintage pieces, as well as purchasing new items from department stores and catalog retailers.
Fiesta collectors often add this new ware to existing collections of vintage Fiesta, while others concentrate on buying from the new assortment.
Early in Fiesta's second incarnation, the Homer Laughlin Company marketed it as a new collectible.
The manufacturer has maintained interest in Fiesta and manipulated the collectors' market over the past 20 years by discontinuing glaze colors, and by limiting production quantities on some items, or controlling production time frames.
Similar techniques have been used by numerous other housewares, china, silver, toy, ornament, etc. companies.
Laughlin has produced new Fiesta in a total of 34 glaze colors, none of which matches exactly any of the thirteen colors of vintage Fiesta.
As of early 2008, many Fiesta shapes exist in a total of 39 color glazes.
In addition to the first five glazes, the names of the new color glazes, in order of introduction, are: Since the reintroduction of Fiesta in 1986, Homer Laughlin has introduced three colors that were available for two years: Lilac (1993–1995), Chartreuse (1997–1999) and Juniper (1999–2001).
Sapphire was sold exclusively at Bloomingdale's from 1996 to 1997.
In November 2008, Homer Laughlin released the limited-edition color, Chocolate.
The color of milk chocolate, the new shade adds a second neutral tone to Fiesta's color palette.
It was available for a limited period of time and in a limited number of pieces.
In 1997, 500 limited-edition presentation bowls in an exclusive Raspberry (reddish maroon) colored glaze were made to commemorate the production of the 500 millionth piece of dinnerware carrying the name Fiesta produced by the Homer Laughlin China Company since 1936.
In anticipation of Fiesta's 75th anniversary in 2011, Homer Laughlin announced its 75th anniversary color: Marigold.
In addition, it introduced the first of a line of specially backstamped annual anniversary items, a set of three baking bowls, at the 2008 International Home and Housewares Show in Chicago, Illinois.
This was followed by the introduction of a large serving platter in 2009 and a numbered soup tureen.
Dinnerware and accessories were available in 2011–2012, with each introduction marketed for 75 weeks, beginning April 1, before being retired.
As an indication of its influence, Fiestaware was featured in a design exhibit at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York City in 1988.
In 2009, a new line of square Fiesta dinnerware was introduced.
Square is available as dinner, luncheon and salad plates, 19 oz. bowls and mugs, four-piece place settings, as well as a full line of accessories.
Despite square silhouettes, pieces maintain a strong relationship to the company's established 'round' deco offering; coupe shape and height remain the same, along with the brand's signature concentric rings.
In October 2016, Fiesta announced the discontinuation of the square bowl (992) and the square mug (923). "American Fiesta", a one-man play written and performed by Steven Tomlinsoni, refers to the central character's obsession with collecting vintage Fiesta dinnerware.

Vladimir Borisovich Antipov (; born January 14, 1978 in Apatity, Russian SFSR) is a Russian former professional ice hockey player who was last signed to play with CSKA Sofia in the Bulgarian Hockey League (BHL).
Antipov began playing for Torpedo Yaroslavl, playing on their junior team.
He was then drafted 103rd overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft and Antipov was promoted to the senior team.
In 1999, Antipov signed with the Maple Leafs organization and in a two-year stay he had spells in the American Hockey League with the St. John's Maple Leafs, the ECHL with the South Carolina Stingrays and the International Hockey League with the Long Beach Ice Dogs but never managed to play in the National Hockey League.
Antipov soon returned to Russia and re-signed with Yaroslavl who changed their name from Torpedo to Lokomotiv.
Antipov would be ever present with the team for the next five seasons until 2006 where he signed for Salavat Yulaev Ufa.
William Hutchinson (1715 probably in Newcastle upon Tyne, England – February 11, 1801 in Liverpool, England) was an English mariner, privateer, author, and inventor who developed parabolic reflectors for lighthouses and helped establish possibly the world's first lifeboat station.
Hutchinson was a seaman by the late 1730s, serving on an East Indiaman trading in India and China.
After service in the Royal Navy, he entered the employ of merchant and privateer Fortunatus Wright.
Hutchinson was captured by the French in 1746 in the "Perl", but by 1748 was master of the "St. George", which captured a French ship.
A voyage in 1750 as captain of Wright's "Lowestoft" ended in shipwreck, and Hutchinson later claimed that only a timely rescue saved him from being eaten by the survivors in his lifeboat, as he had drawn the short straw.
After time ashore in Liverpool, he later returned to privateering, captaining the 22-gun frigate "Liverpool" (1757-8).
In 1759, Hutchinson was appointed dockmaster at Liverpool, and he held this and other positions at the harbour until 1793.
In 1764 he started keeping detailed tide and weather records, and his data - the earliest continuous set of tidal records in the United Kingdom - contributed to the production of "Holden's Tide Tables", which continued in use until the 1970s.
In 1777 he first published "A Treatise on Practical Seamanship...", which went through a number of editions and by 1794 was titled "A Treatise on Naval Architecture..."; it contained Hutchinson's advice and ideas on seamanship, ship design, and other maritime subjects, as well as autobiographical material.
Around 1763 Hutchinson installed what may have been the first parabolic reflector in a lighthouse in the new Leasowe Lighthouse, and later at a lighthouse in Hoylake.
He also experimented with oil-burning lights for lighthouses, invented a new rudder and a better quick-priming mechanism for large guns, and worked with Dr. Thomas Houlston on better methods of artificial respiration for drowning victims.
He helped establish possibly the world's first lifeboat station, at Formby.
In 1789 Hutchinson helped found the Liverpool Marine Society for indigent seamen, widows of seamen, and their families; he contributed 100 guineas.
Michael Charles Zerner (January 1, 1940 – February 2, 2000) was an American theoretical chemist, professor at the University of Guelph from 1970 to 1981 and University of Florida from 1981 to 2000.
Zerner earned his Ph.D. under Martin Gouterman at Harvard, working with the spectroscopy of porphyrins.
He conceived and wrote a quantum chemistry program, known as BIGSPEC or ZINDO, for calculating electronic spectra of big molecules.
In 1996 Zerner was diagnosed with liver cancer, and died on February 2, 2000, survived by his wife and two children.

The House of Commons Treasury Committee (often referred to as the 'Treasury Select Committee') is a select committee of the House of Commons in the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
The remit of the committee is to examine the expenditure, administration and policy of HM Treasury, with all of its agencies and associated bodies, including HM Revenue and Customs, the Bank of England, the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Royal Mint, and so on.
Since 2010 the Treasury committee has taken on new powers, including the right to veto appointments to the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, and has forced the Financial Services Authority to publish a detailed report into its handling of the collapse of Royal Bank of Scotland.
In June 2015, Andrew Tyrie was elected as the Committee's chair.
The remaining members were appointed in July and served for the 2015-2017 session as follows: Source: Treasury Committee On 12 July 2017, Nicky Morgan became the new chair of the committee.
Occasionally, the House of Commons orders changes to be made in terms of membership of select committees, as proposed by the Committee of Selection.
Such changes are shown below.
From June 2010 chairs of select committees have been directly elected by a secret ballot of the whole House of Commons using the alternative vote system.
Candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated and their votes redistributed until one remaining candidate has more than half of valid votes.
Elections are held at the beginning of a parliament or in the event of a vacancy.

The American Federation of Women Bodybuilders was formed in 1980, started by Susan Fry, Kim Cassidy and Doris Barrilleaux.
Ben Weider had asked them to start up a national organization for women bodybuilders, to provide a place where amateur women bodybuilders can be in a group.
The Superior Physique Association (SPA) eventually fell by the wayside as a result of the AFWB.
This AFWB was absorbed by the National Physique Committee (NPC) when it was formed, as it was illegal to have two separate amateur federations for the IFBB.
Slieve Gullion ( or "Sliabh Cuilinn", "Culann's mountain") is a mountain in the south of County Armagh, Northern Ireland.
The mountain is the heart of the Ring of Gullion and is the highest point in the county, with an elevation of .
At the summit is a small lake and two ancient burial cairns, one of which is the highest surviving passage grave in Ireland.
Slieve Gullion appears in Irish mythology, where it is associated with the Cailleach and the heroes Fionn mac Cumhaill and Cú Chulainn.
It dominates the countryside around it, offering views as far away as Antrim, Dublin Bay and Wicklow on a clear day.
Slieve Gullion Forest Park is on its eastern slope.
Villages around Slieve Gullion include Meigh, Drumintee, Forkhill, Mullaghbawn and Lislea.
The mountain gives its name to the surrounding countryside, and is the name of an electoral area within Newry and Mourne district.
Slieve Gullion is a steep-sided mountain with a flat top and a height of .
It is the eroded remains of a Paleocene volcanic complex.
It is surrounded by a ring dike known as the Ring of Gullion, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).
Slieve Gullion has been shaped by glaciation and exhibits a classic 'crag and tail' glacial feature.
The 'tail', made up of glacial deposits, points south, ending at Drumintee.
The geological formation was the first ring dike to be mapped, although its significance was not understood until similar structures had been described from Scotland.
The rocks of the area are complex and have featured in international geological debate since the 1950s.
The site has attracted geologists from all over the world and featured in a number of theories that have been put forward to explain the unusual rock relationships.
Some of these theories have now become an accepted part of geological science.
Much of Slieve Gullion is covered with forest, heather, or raw stone, while 612 hectares of dry heath on the mountain has been designated a Special Area of Conservation, an Environmentally Sensitive Area, and an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
In July 2006, some areas of gorse were destroyed by a wildfire which may have been started deliberately.
Traces of fields on the mountain's poor soil from farming in earlier times can still be seen.
There is also evidence of past quarrying.
There are two burial cairns on top of the mountain, on either side of a small lake.
The southern one is a large passage tomb, the highest surviving passage tomb in Ireland.
In 1961, a team of archaeologists explored the site and set up a 30-person camp near the summit.
The tomb's cairn is 30 m (97 ft) wide and 5 m (16 ft) high.
The chamber inside is 3.6 m (12 ft) wide, with a corbelled roof up to 4.3 m (14 ft) high.
It contained three large blocks of stone seemingly used as basins, and fragments of human bone.
Some bits of worked flint and a barbed-end arrowhead were also found, "the meager remnants that survived the centuries of tomb raiding".
The entrance is aligned with the setting sun on the winter solstice.
Radiocarbon dating suggests it was built c.3500–2900 BCE.
The smaller cairn to the north of the lake was built later, perhaps during the Bronze Age.
It contains two cist burials, with one containing bits of burnt bone; likely the remains of a single adult.
The two cairns were disturbed by American soldiers training there during World War II.
Irish folklore holds that it is bad luck to damage or disrespect such tombs and that doing so could bring a curse.
Today they are historic monuments protected by law.
In recent years, volunteers have helped to repair the burial cairns under the supervision of an archaeologist.
Slieve Gullion is popular with hillwalkers, with about 20,000 people climbing the mountain every year.
A road leads to a small carpark about halfway up the western side of the mountain.
From there is a trail leading to the summit.
There is also a waymarked trail from the northern side of the mountain.
As there is no security on the mountainside, cars parked there are often broken into by thieves, and police have asked visitors not to leave valuables in cars.
On the eastern side of the mountain is Slieve Gullion Forest Park, which includes a visitors' centre, café, playground, and the Giant's Lair Story Trail.
Slieve Gullion appears in Irish mythology.
In the tale known as "The Hunt of Slieve Gullion", Áine and her sister Milucra both seek after the legendary hero Fionn mac Cumhaill (Finn McCool).
Knowing that Áine vowed never to marry a man with grey hair, Milucra secretly puts a spell on the lake atop Slieve Gullion, so that anyone who swam in it would become elderly.
She tricks Fionn by asking him to fetch her golden ring from the lake, and he emerges as an old man with grey-white hair.
His men, the Fianna, force her to give him a restorative potion from her cornucopia.
Fionn's youth returns, but his hair does not return to its true colour.
This is said to be the origin of his name, Fionn, meaning 'white'.
In some versions of the tale, Milucra is revealed to be the Cailleach Bhéara (Calliagh Birra), an ancient goddess.
The names of several features on the mountain refer to the Cailleach Bhéara.
The passage grave is known as Calliagh Birra's House and the small lake is called Calliagh Birra's Lough.
Lower down, on a hillock called Spellick, is a rock feature called the Calliagh Birra's Chair.
Locals would visit it at Lughnasadh and take turns sitting on the chair.
Slieve Gullion is said to be where the legendary hero Cú Chulainn (Cuhullin) received his name and where he spent his childhood as Sétanta.
According to myth, the mountain is named after Culann the metalsmith.
Culann invites Conchobhar mac Neasa, king of Ulster, to a feast at his house on the slopes of Slieve Gullion.
On his way, Conchobhar stops at the playing field to watch the boys play hurling.
He is so impressed by Sétanta's performance that he asks him to join him at the feast.
Sétanta promises to join him after he finishes his game.
Conchobhar goes ahead, but he forgets about Sétanta, and Culann lets loose his ferocious hound to guard his house.
When Sétanta arrives, the hound attacks him, but he kills it; in one version by smashing it against a standing stone, in another by driving a sliotar (hurling ball) down its throat with his hurley.
Culann is devastated by the loss of his hound, so Sétanta promises to rear him a replacement, and until it was old enough to do the job, he himself would guard Culann's house.
The druid Cathbhadh announces that his name henceforth would be Cú Chulainn, "Culann's Hound".
In the "Táin Bó Cuailnge", the nearby Gap of the North is where Cú Chulainn single-handedly fends-off the army of queen Méabh.
Sandra Prinsloo (born 15 September 1947), also known as Sandra Prinzlow, is a South African actress best known internationally for her role as Kate Thompson in the 1980 film "The Gods Must Be Crazy".
Prinsloo has also appeared in numerous South African television, film, and stage productions.
Prinsloo has stated that she never expected to become an actress. “I was a ballet dancer from a very early age and I remember that I occasionally ushered at the Breytenbach Theatre in Pretoria when I was in high school.
That’s the first time I came into contact with professional stage acting, but I never thought I’d be an actress . .
. .
I think I was far too shy in those days to ever think I could be an actress.
So it wasn’t like I had this great big burning passion to become an actress, not at all.
I preferred an academic life, in a way.
When I went to university, I thought that was going to be what I was going to do”.
Prinsloo matriculated from the Afrikaanse Hoër Meisieskool and then completed her B.A. honours in drama at the University of Pretoria.
Soon after, she became a member of the Performing Arts Council Transvaal acting company. “One night we were performing and it was as if something absolutely magical happened.
It was as if a golden net was cast down.
Everything was magical that evening and everybody felt it in the cast ...
It was something enchanting that happens in the exchange of the energy between the audience and the actors”.
Prinsloo has said that after that night, she realised that acting was her calling.
In addition to her well-known role in "The Gods Must Be Crazy," Prinsloo has had major roles in "Target of an Assassin" (1979), "Quest for Love" (1988), "Die Prins van Pretoria" (1992), "Soweto Green" (1995), "'n Paw Paw Vir My Darling" (2015), "Twee Grade van Moord" (2016).
Prinsloo was in the original cast of "," South Africa's first soap opera.
For many years, she hosted her own talk show, "RaakPraat met Sandra," on South Africa television.
She has also conducted a series of interviews with personalities and celebrities for South African TV, "Sandra Op 'n Drafstap."
Prinsloo has acted in a number of South African television series and movies throughout her career, including "Erfsondes" (2012); "Hartland" (2011); "Known Gods" (2005); "Saints, Sinners, and Settlers" (1999); and "Konings" (1991) among others.
Prinsloo has performed in more than 100 different productions, often playing leading roles in works by South African and international dramatists.
In 1985, Prinsloo and fellow actor John Kani caused a South African audience walk-out when performing the play "Miss Julie" by August Strindberg.
In the title role, Prinsloo played a white woman seducing a black man.
The play marked the first on-stage occurrence of a black man kissing a white woman under the Apartheid regime.
The play's producer, Bobby Heaney, speculated that the walk-out was "part of a well planned campaign by conservative whites".
Both Kani and Prinsloo had to be escorted into the parking lot after each performance of "Miss Julie," as there was fear that the actors would be attacked by "enraged right-wingers".
Prinsloo reportedly received obscene hate mail and both received death threats.
When interviewed in 2014 for the "21 Icons Project", a series of short films about South Africans "who have shaped the world around them", Prinsloo commented that "“I thought [the play] would cause a stir, but I didn’t think it would cause a minor revolution.
People were very small-minded and I suppose you live in a bit of a fool’s paradise when you’re an actor".
The actors later performed the play at the Edinburgh Festival.
In 1986, Heaney directed a TV movie of the play for Swedish and Finnish television, which starred both Prinsloo and Kani.
Prinsloo returned to the Edinburgh Festival in 2012 with "The Sewing Machine," an English-language translation of the Afrikaans-language play, "Die Naaimasjien."
In the 2000s, Prinsloo appeared on the South African stage in productions of "Oskar en die Pienk Tannie; Janneman; Nag, Ma (Night Mother);" and "Liefde, Anna."
In October 2015 Prinsloo will portray South African journalist, Jani Allan in "Jani" at the Aardklop festival.
In 2013, Prinsloo received the ACT Lifetime Achievement Award for Theatre.
The awards are offered annually by the Arts and Culture Trust (ACT) of South Africa in order to "honour arts professionals whose extraordinary careers have had a profound and lasting impact on arts, culture and heritage, and whose lifetime achievements have contributed significantly to the enrichment of cultural life in South Africa".
In 2014, Prinsloo was the recipient of a national order by the South African government, the Order of Ikhamanga in silver, for those whose outstanding work has benefited South Africa.
National orders are bestowed on South Africa's Freedom Day.
The orders celebrate human achievement in various fields, honouring men and women who have left definitive footprints in both the struggle for liberation and in building a better South Africa.
In 2018, Prinsloo was the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Naledi Theatre Awards The awards are offered annually by the Naledi Theatre Awards Committee.
Prinsloo matriculated from the Afrikaanse Hoër Meisieskool.
She holds the degree B.A. (Honours) from the University of Pretoria.
The Council for Higher Education in Israel (, "HaMo'atza LeHaskala Gevoha") is a supervisory body for universities and colleges in Israel.
It is the only organization with the authority to award academic educational accreditation.
The head of the council is always the Minister of Education, and at least two-thirds of its members are academics.
The council is located in Albert Einstein Square, Jerusalem, next to the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities.
The council was established in 1958, a time at which most of the academic institutions were dependent on the governmental budget, and there was concern among academics that the government would politically influence higher education institutions.
In 1956 the government appointed a special committee, which was supposed to advise the government how to act, in order to assure that no ruling political party will be able to influence the academic institutions.
The Governor of the Bank of Israel, David Horowitz, was the head of the committee, which advised the government to appoint a special apolitical and academic council which would supervise the functioning of the academic institutions and their relations with the government.
Soon after, in 1958, the Knesset passed the Council for Higher Education Law, which established the organisation.
In December 2005, new legislation came into force, which enlarged the student representation at the council from one to two members, one for university students and one for college students.
The total budget of the council, which is funded by the government, is 6 billion NIS per year, which is then transferred to the public universities and colleges.
Among its duties, the council is responsible for the establishment of new universities and the expansion of existing universities.
The most important body of the council is the committee for budget and planning, which deals with the division of funding between the various universities and colleges.
A Dark and Hungry God Arises (or officially "The Gap into Power: A Dark and Hungry God Arises") is a science fiction novel by American writer Stephen R. Donaldson, the third book of "The Gap Cycle" series.
As the newly 'welded' cyborg Angus Thermopyle and his distrusted companion Milos Taverner arrive in their Gap Scout, Trumpet, at the illegal outpost in Amnion space known as Billingate, The Bill, the ruler of Billingate, intercepts the escape pod containing Morn Hyland's recently forcegrown child, Davies Hyland.
Despite being only a few days old, the forcegrowing technique the Amnion used on him have made him physically resemble a sixteen-year-old boy.
Morn suffers from an insanity-causing ailment known as Gap Sickness for which she uses a device called a zone implant in the event of gap travel.
When Morn's mind was copied onto Davies' during the force growing process to make up for his lack of a developmental/formative childhood, Morn somehow survived the copying which, it was explained, should have killed her.
The Amnion, a misanthropic alien race bent on the eventual domination of the human race, and the ones who conceded to perform the force growing of Davies, suspect that it is the presence of Morn's zone implant that saved her; these circumstances make the mother and son uniquely valuable to the Amnion.
The Amnion have followed Morn and her son to Billingate in the hopes of getting them back for further study.
Captain Nick Succorso, aboard his ship the Captain's Fancy, is furious at Morn for not only making him think that she loved him, but, more recently, for diverting the escape pod containing her son away from an Amnion warship.
Nick had promised Davies to the Amnion as a show of good faith.
In his fury he gives them Morn, but not before she has broken into his quarters to steal an immunization drug designed to counteract Amnion mutagens that would turn her into one of them.
Nick is left in a precarious position.
The Amnion continue to demand Davies Hyland, but Davies is in the custody of The Bill, who shrewdly asks for compensation for the child.
Because of their convoluted dealings, the Amnion have revoked a credit voucher they gave Nick, so he has no credit to give The Bill for Davies.
Because of this, Nick is stuck on Billingate and simply wanders the 'cruise'.
After Milos finishes abusing Angus by using the priority codes for Angus' computer, which were given to him by UMCPHQ, Angus and Milos disembark at Billingate and eventually meet up with Angus' nemesis, Nick.
They form an uneasy truce.
Nick explains that he needs Davies and will give Morn to them in exchange for Morn's son, should Nick be able to recover him.
Nick of course does not mention he's already handed Morn over to the Amnion and, as far as he knows, has already been turned into one of them.
Angus and Milos are surprised to learn that Angus' programming includes rescuing Morn, something they were told was not the case.
Milos becomes furious and begins to distrust his orders, the UMCP and Angus.
While waiting for Nick to find out where Davies is being held, Milos asserts his previously unperceived control over Angus, making him eat his live nic butts, in front of Billingate's bug eyes - a mistake that will cost him later.
After finding out where the detention centre is, Angus' computer reveals to him that he is capable of emitting a type of jamming field that can bend light rendering him invisible to electronic surveillance, thus protecting his identity.
His programming makes him take Milos with him, because he cannot really be trusted on his own.
They descend into the depths of Billingate, where they find Davies locked away in a cell.
When Nick handed Morn over to the Amnion, some of his crew, Mikka Vasaczk, Nick's second in command, Vector Shaheed, his engineer, Sib Mackern, his data first, and Ciro "Pup" Vasaczk, Vector's assistant, all begin to turn against him.
Sensing a mutiny, Nick sends them to do specific tasks on Billingate to 'get them out of the way'.
Against orders, they all meet up and decide to abandon Captain's Fancy as they've clearly outlived their usefulness to Nick.
When Angus and Milos return to Trumpet with Davies, they confront Nick when he arrives and decide to keep Davies rather than hand him over to Nick, who intends to turn him over to the Amnion.
Nick also reveals that Morn is in Amnion custody.
Angus begins to form a plan to rescue her when Milos, and then Nick, leave the ship.
Milos immediately heads to the Amnion sector of Billingate and there it becomes apparent that he's been working for them as a double agent for some time.
The Amnion emissary, Marc Vestabule, an abortive Amnion attempt at turning a human into an Amnion while maintaining a human-like appearance, informs Milos that both they and The Bill are aware that he has some kind of control over Angus.
Vestabule then, to Milos' extreme horror, subdues Milos and injects him with Amnion mutagens.
In the meantime Nick is confronted by his former crew: Mikka, Vector, Sib and Pup.
While arguing, they are all approached by Billingate security and Nick, being barred from Captain's Fancy, flees for Trumpet while being pursued by Mikka and company, followed closely by security.
Angus reluctantly lets them in.
While The Bill rages over the comm, they begin to formulate and act out a plan to rescue Morn.
Nick contacts Captain's Fancy and instructs Liete Corregio, his third in command, to attack the ship called Soar, as Nick has discovered that it is captained by Sorus Chatelaine, a woman who seduced, betrayed and abandoned Nick as a young man, but not before leaving the streaked scars underneath his eyes that act as his emotional barometer.
Angus instructs Davies, Vector and Pup to sabotage Billingate's communications systems while Nick, Mikka, Sib and Angus himself go EVA to the Amnion sector to rescue Morn.
After breaking inside, Angus is confronted by Milos, who has now been turned into an Amnion while still retaining his human memories, mannerisms and form - the Amnion apparently having perfected their mutagens.
Milos attempts to use Angus' priority codes against him and his newfound allies, but new programming takes over that overrides those codes with new ones, allowing Angus both to ignore Milos' orders and attempt to kill him.
Milos escapes, but they soon find Morn in her cell, still human thanks to the immunity drug she stole from Nick.
Angus puts Mikka in charge and gets Sib to help Morn into the spare EVA suit they brought when he suddenly leaves to sabotage Billingate's reactor.
On their way back to Trumpet, the rescue party witnesses an Amnion shuttle containing The Bill leave the station, as well as the destruction of an Amnion warship that had been rammed by Captain's Fancy, which Leite did to prevent the ship from firing on Mikka, Morn, Sib and Nick while they were walking across the face of Billingate.
When back on Trumpet, Nick attempts to take over the ship by holding Pup hostage, demanding that they leave without Angus.
Pup manages to subdue Nick with a stun prod he landed on when forced into Milos' old command station.
Then Angus appears back on board and begins to get Trumpet ready to leave.
While Nick and Angus finish the preparations, everyone else leaves for quarters to secure for heavy g. An Amnion warship and a few other human pirate ships converge on Trumpet as it disengages from Billingate just as Billingate's reactor explodes.
Trumpet escapes into the gap, presumably leaving all the other ships left behind to be destroyed.
Meanwhile, back on Earth, Warden Dios, the director of the UMCP, gathers together his directors, Min Donner, director of the UMCP's Enforcement Division (ED), Hashi Lebwohl, director of Data Acquisition (DA), and Godsen Frik, director of Protocol (PR), for a video conference with the Governing Council of Earth and Space (GCES), brought about by the apparent escape of the known pirate Angus Thermopyle and suspected traitor Milos Taverner, as such was their cover story when they left UMCPHQ.
The GCES demands disclosure and uses the opportunity to ask about Morn Hyland, a UMCP ensign they apparently abandoned to pirates and the Amnion.
Warden and Hashi offer half-truths to the Council, telling them that they failed to recapture Angus and Milos, and that they arranged for Morn to be given to Nick as 'payment' for a job they had him do so that she could be used as a bargaining chip should Nick's mission at Billingate fail.
The mission was to give a non-working anti-mutagen drug in hopes that it would disrupt Billingate's usefulness to the Amnion, not letting on that they gave him a working anti-mutagen drug that the UMCP suppressed years previous.
Later Dios admits to Min in confidence that he did this purposely in hopes to get the UMCP severed from the UMC so that it would be reformed under the GCES.
Dios hopes to disrupt the power that Holt Fasner, the CEO of the UMC, has over human controlled space.
He then instructs Min to leave UMCPHQ, which is orbiting Earth, for Suka Bator.
There Min meets with Captain Sixten Vertigus, the man who made first contact with the Amnion, and is now a member of the GCES.
She convinces him to propose a bill of severance that would put the UMCP under the control of the GCES, persuading him to act as if it was his own idea so that no one would know that Min Donner or Warden Dios had anything to do with it.
As Min is about to leave, she and Sixten are attacked by a kaze that Min recognizes in time to prevent the kaze's surgically implanted explosives from killing them.
Despite being injured, Min then leaves so that no one knows she was there.
The Kaze causes the GCES to announce a state of emergency, suspending GCES meetings until further notice.
Warden Dios declares a similar lockdown at UMCPHQ, suspecting that Frik or Fasner might be behind the kaze to keep Sixten from proposing the bill of severance that Dios hoped only he, Min and Sixten knew about.
Fasner attempts to summon Frik to his private orbiting station, but Frik refuses, citing Dios' orders as explanation, but in actuality he would rather not confront his boss and mentor.
Another kaze kills Frik.
Dios is summoned to Fasner's home instead and is asked to explain why he disclosed so much information as to horrify the GCES, and why he restricted Frik's movements, resulting in his death.
Dios manages to answer, but does not completely satisfy Fasner.
Fasner mentions that he is aware that Dios sent Min Donner to the borders of forbidden space to await the return of Angus and Milos.
He instructs Dios to tell Donner to kill Angus and Milos should anything go wrong.
The station is at ground floor level, and access to the platforms are by ramps.
There are two entrances, one on either side of the level crossing where the line crosses Jiyū-dōri: one for platform 1, the other for platforms 2 and 3.
Passengers must choose their direction of travel before passing through the ticket gates, as there is no footbridge or underpass between the platforms.
This station consists of one side platform and one island platform serving three tracks.
The station opened on March 11, 1923.
In 2014, 13,636 passengers per day started or ended travel at the station in average.
The Nokia 2650 was first made public in the second quarter of 2004.
The model was one of Nokia's few clamshell releases at that time, and being an entry-level phone, it became popular largely due to its low price.

William Headline (December 24, 1931 – October 20, 2008) served as Washington bureau chief for 12 years during the formative years of CNN and headed the Voter News Service during the United States 2000 presidential election.
Given his name and his profession, Wolf Blitzer described Headline as having "the best name in news".
William Headline was born in Cleveland, Ohio and grew up in East Aurora, New York.
The family surname had been Americanized by his Swedish immigrant ancestors.
Headline attended Ohio Wesleyan University where he majored in geology.
He was an intelligence officer in the United States Navy prior to his career in journalism.
He worked for Louis Harris and Associates in New York gathering polling information.
CBS News in New York hired him to work on coverage of the 1964 presidential election.
Headline was promoted to senior vice president and later moved to Washington in 1974 as the network's assistant bureau chief.
In his years at CBS News, Headline supervised the network's coverage of political conventions, overseas presidential trips and papal visits, and was the network pool producer during President Richard Nixon's resignation.
Headline was hired by CNN in 1983, and was appointed as the network's bureau chief in Washington, D.C., filling a position that had been occupied by six different individuals in the three years before he was hired.
As bureau chief, Headline oversaw the growth of CNN Washington bureau from 80 to 350 staff members.
He remained as bureau chief until 1996, when CNN named him to serve as the vice president managing special projects and pool assignments.
He served as the chairman of the Washington-based Radio and Television Correspondents' Association.
Headline left CNN in 1998 and became the executive director of the Voter News Service, a consortium of television networks and newspapers that used exit polling and vote tallies to project election winners.
The organization faced criticism after the United States 2000 presidential election, when it incorrectly projected that Vice President Al Gore had won the election.
Headline was quoted in 2001 stating that "We were aware some of the computer hardware we have was antiquated," but that "it was actually a good night" when the number of races it projected correctly are considered.
The Voter News Service was shut down in January 2003 after it was unable to fix its problems; Headline stated that two years "was much too ambitious" a timeframe for the organization to solve its issues.
Headline died on October 20, 2008 at age 76 after falling in his home in Bethesda, Maryland.
Tit Galop Pour Mamou (English: either "Canter to Mamou" or "Giddy-Yap to Mamou") is a Cajun folk song with words and music by Dewey Balfa.
The tune behind Joe South's "Games People Play" resembles the tune of "Tit Galop Pour Mamou" to some extent.
A recording of the song by Mamou Master was used on the soundtrack of the 1991 film Scorchers.
The song was also recorded as the title cut of a 1992 album by Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys.
The album was first released 1965 and is considered Volume 1.
Volume 2 was released in 1974 however, in 1994, both were re-released as a double album set.
The song’s narrator tells of a trip to the Louisiana town of Mamou, where he sells his mule and wagon for 15 cents to buy candies for children and sugar and coffee for older people.

The Portuguese East India Company ( or ) was a short-lived ill-fated attempt by Philip III of Portugal to create a national chartered company to look after interests in Portuguese India in the face on encroachment by the Dutch and English following the personal union of the Portuguese and Spanish Crowns.
Portuguese trade with India had been a crown monopoly since the Portuguese captain Vasco da Gama opened the sea route to India in 1497-99.
The monopoly had been managed by the Casa da Índia, the royal trading house founded around 1500.
The Casa was responsible for the yearly India armadas.
However, by 1560, the Casa's finances were in dire straits and in 1570, King Sebastian of Portugal issued a decree opening up trade to India to any private Portuguese national.
As few took up the offer, the free trade decree was replaced in 1578 by a new system of annual monopolies, where the Casa sold India trading contracts to a private Portuguese merchant consortium, granting them a monopoly for one year.
This annual contract system was abandoned in 1597, and the royal monopoly resumed.
The Iberian Union of 1580, which gave King Philip II of Spain the crown of Portugal, changed little at first.
But the vigorous Dutch VOC and English EIC encroachments on the Portuguese empire and trade in Asia after 1598 forced the king to experiment with different arrangements to defend the Portuguese positions.
In 1605, he created the "Conselho da Índia", to bring affairs in Portuguese India under closer supervision of the Habsburg crown.
But this conflicted with older lines of Portuguese authority, and the council was eventually dissolved in 1614.
It was around this time (1614) that the idea for a chartered private Portuguese East Indies company, organized along the lines of Dutch and English companies, was first broached.
This was promoted by Portuguese New Christian merchant and Mercantilist pamphleteer Duarte Gomes Solis who lived in Madrid, most notably in his Spanish language tract "Discursos sobre los Comercios de las Indias" (published 1622, although circulated earlier).
Solis argued that a private joint stock company could raise more capital, revive the Asian trade and compete more efficiently with the Anglo-Dutch in the Indian Ocean.
King Philip III of Portugal put the idea in motion in 1624 and appointed D. Jorge Mascarenhas, mayor of Lisbon and member of the Council of State, to head a committee to implement Solis proposal.
Despite being supported by Olivares, the proposal faced much skepticism and opposition, particularly by the Duke of Villahermosa (head of the Council of Portugal), and Mascarenhas had considerable trouble securing investment commitments.
The "Companhia do commércio da Índia" (or "Companhia da Índia Oriental") finally came into existence in August 1628, when it was granted a charter by King Philip III.
The Companhia was to be governed by a "Câmara de Administração Geral", composed of a president (Jorge Mascarenhas) and six administrators, elected by the investors, with full powers, although its judicial acts, administrative practices and finances were subject to review by an advisory "Conselho do Comércio" (Board of Trade) in the king's court in Madrid.
The charter envisaged a two-year transition period, during which the royal "Conselho da Fazenda" would continue to supervise the India fleets, the Casa da Índia and the Armazém da Índia, before passing them all over to the Companhia's administration.
The Companhia would be in charge of running & collecting the customs dues payable at the Casa.
The Companhia was established with a joint-stock block of six years, renewable for another six with a minimum subscription of 100 "cruzados".
The Companhia was granted a monopoly on trade in coral, pepper, cinnamon, ebony and cowrie shells, and could be extended to other items upon request.
It had full administrative & juridical privileges, including the right to keep all spoils from seizures of Dutch and English ships (after deducting the royal fifth).
The crown was the largest investor, committing 1,500,000 cruzados for the first three years.
Although some municipalities (esp.
Lisbon) also invested, private individuals were less interested.
To make it attractive, subscribers were guaranteed an annual return of 4% plus dividends and the subscriptions were laced with various privileges (e.g. title in king's household, protection from debt seizure, even the capital of New Christians convicted by the Portuguese Inquisition, had a measure of protection).
Although there were provisions against allowing any other East Indies company to be formed in Habsburg territories, investment in the Companhia was open to all subjects of Philip III and his allies (thus Spaniards, Italians, Flemings, etc.)
Nonetheless, none of this was enough to garner much enthusiasm from private individuals.
The company was launched with only around half the capital it originally sought to raise.
The Companhia proved unsuccessful.
Investors remained skeptical, overseas Portuguese merchants rejected the new Companhia's authority, and the Anglo-Dutch breach of the old Portuguese empire in Asia had become irreparable, squeezing margins on the spice trade.
The Companhia proved unprofitable, and soon ceased operating and was liquidated in April, 1633.
The Casa da Índia and the India trade was brought back under the supervision of the "Conselho da Fazenda" (royal finance council).

Friedrich Spielhagen (24 February 1829 – 25 February 1911) was a German novelist, literary theorist and translator.
He tried a number of careers in his early 20s, but at 25 began writing and translating.
His best known novel is "Sturmflut" and his novel "In Reih' und Glied" was quite successful in Russia.
Spielhagen was born in Magdeburg and brought up in Stralsund, where his father was appointed a government architect in 1835.
He attended the gymnasium (roughly equivalent to an American high school) in Stralsund, studied law, and subsequently literature and philosophy at the universities of Berlin, Bonn and Greifswald.
At Bonn, he was a member of the Burschenschaft Franconia, which at that time also included Carl Schurz, Johannes Overbeck, Julius Schmidt, Carl Otto Weber, Ludwig Meyer and Adolf Strodtmann.
In his "Reminiscences", Schurz recalls Spielhagen as a person “in whom, in spite of his somewhat distant and reserved character, we all recognized a man of rare intellectuality and moral elevation, and who later became a star of the first magnitude among the novelists of the century.” After leaving university, he tried his hand at being a private tutor, an actor, a soldier and a teacher in a school in Leipzig, but upon his father's death in 1854 he devoted himself entirely to writing.
In 1859, he became editor of the "Zeitung für Norddeutschland" (Newspaper for Northern Germany) in Hannover, and then, in 1862, moved to Berlin where he later edited "Westermanns illustrirte deutsche Monatshefte" (Westermann's Illustrated German Monthly) 1878-84.
As a translator, Spielhagen rendered into German George William Curtis's "Howadji", Ralph Waldo Emerson's "English Traits", a selection of American poems (1859; 2d ed. 1865), and William Roscoe's "Lorenzo de' Medici".
He also translated from the French minor works of Jules Michelet: "L'amour", "La femme", "La mer".
He married Therese Boutin (1835–1900) with whom he had a daughter, Elsa Spielhagen (1866–1942).
He died on 25 February 1911.
Streets are named after him in his hometown of Magdeburg, as well as the three cities in which he lived: Stralsund, Hannover, and Berlin.
After publishing "Clara Vere" (1857) and "Auf der Düne" (1858), neither of which was widely read, he began to write for newspapers and journals.
In 1861, he struck gold with "Problematische Naturen" (1860–1861; English translation “Problematic Characters,” by Prof. Schele de Vere, New York, 1869); it was followed a year later by a sequel, "Durch Nacht zum Licht" (English translation, “Through Night to Light,” by Prof. Schele de Vere, New York, 1869), then by "Die von Hohenstein" (1863; English translation, “The Hohensteins,” by Prof. Schele de Vere, 1870), "In Reih' und Glied" (1866), "Hammer und Amboß" (1869; English translation, “Hammer and Anvil,” by William Hand Browne, 1873), "Deutsche Pioniere" (1870), "Allzeit voran" (1872), "Was die Schwalbe sang" (1873; English translation, “What the Swallow Sang,” 1873), "Ultimo" (1874), "Liebe für Liebe" (a drama, which was produced in Leipzig; 1875), "Sturmflut" (based on the financial crises in Berlin following the Franco-Prussian War; 1876), "Plattland" (1878), "Quisisana" (1880), "Angela" (1881), "Uhlenhans" (1884), "Ein neuer Pharao" (1889), "Faustulus" (1897) and "Freigeboren" (1900) among many others.
These days, "Sturmflut" is his best known work though it is currently only available in an abridged form.
Spielhagen's later works were almost entirely on literary theory.
Spielhagen's "Sämtliche Werke" (Complete Works) were published in 1871 in sixteen volumes, in 1878 in fourteen volumes.
His "Sämtliche Romane" (Complete Novels) followed in 1898 (22 vols), and these were followed by a new series in 1902.
In 1890, he published his autobiography, "Finder und Erfinder" (2 vols, 1890).
His novel "In Reih' und Glied", translated into Russian as "Один в поле не воин" [literally "Odin v pole ne voin", a proverb meaning "One man in the field is not a warrior" or "One man alone can't win a war"] (1867–1868), with its revolutionary protagonist Leo (based on Ferdinand Lassalle), was extraordinarily popular in Russia, and virtually all his novels were subsequently translated there at least once, collected editions being brought out in 1895 (8 vols.) and 1898 (30 vols.

Seán Patrick O'Malley (born June 29, 1944) is an American cardinal of the Catholic Church serving as the Archbishop of Boston.
O'Malley is a member of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, commonly known as the Capuchins.
O'Malley was elevated to the cardinalate in 2006.
He was considered a papabile contender to succeed Pope Benedict XVI, who resigned on February 28, 2013, until Pope Francis was chosen on March 13, 2013.
On April 13, 2013, Francis appointed O'Malley as one of eight cardinals of the Council of Cardinal Advisers to help the Pope govern the Catholic Church and reform its central administration.
On January 14, 2017, Francis appointed O'Malley to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.
Seán Patrick O'Malley was born as Patrick O'Malley on June 29, 1944, in Lakewood, Ohio, the son of Theodore and Mary Louise (née Reidy) O'Malley.
Both parents were of Irish descent.
O'Malley, his sister, and his older brother grew up in South Hills of Pittsburgh, and Reading, Pennsylvania.
At age 12, he entered St. Fidelis Minor Seminary in Herman, a boarding school for students who were considering joining the Franciscan order.
While there, in addition to studying the normal high school subjects, he also studied Spanish, Portuguese, Greek, German, and Hebrew, and he was active in theatre.
After graduating from St. Fidelis, he attended Capuchin College in Washington, DC, and the Catholic University of America, where he is now a member of the Board of Trustees.
On July 14, 1965, at the age of 21, O'Malley professed his vows in the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin and took the name Seán in honor of St. John the Apostle.
After he was ordained a deacon, he spent a brief period in Easter Island, Chile.
He was ordained a priest on August 29, 1970, at age 26, by Bishop John Bernard McDowell, an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.
After ordination he graduated from The Catholic University of America with a master's degree in religious education and a Ph.D. in Spanish and Portuguese literature.
O'Malley served as a professor at The Catholic University from 1969 to 1973.
In 1973, he was asked to minister to Latinos living in the Washington, DC, area at the Spanish Catholic Center.
The Center was founded in 1967 by the Archdiocese of Washington, and it was originally headed by Spanish missionaries Fr.
Rutílio and Sister Ana María.
It is an organization which provided educational, medical and legal help to immigrants.
He opened a Spanish bookstore and founded "El Pregonero", the first Spanish newspaper in the DC area.
In 1978, Cardinal William Wakefield Baum appointed him episcopal vicar for the Portuguese, Hispanic, and Haitian communities, and he became the executive director of the archdiocesan Office of Social Ministry.
He was also named knight commander of the Order of Infante D. Henrique by Portugal in 1985 for his service to the Portuguese people.
He says his daily prayers in Spanish.
O'Malley was appointed coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of Saint Thomas on May 30, 1984, by Pope John Paul II.
He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 2 by Bishop Edward John Harper, with Archbishop James Hickey and Bishop Eugene Marino serving as co-consecrators.
He served as coadjutor for one year and then succeeded Harper as Bishop of Saint Thomas on October 16, 1985, upon Harper's resignation.
While in the Virgin Islands, he worked with the homeless and opened a home for people with AIDS.
He was made an honorary chaplain of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in 1991.
On June 16, 1992, O'Malley was chosen to head the Diocese of Fall River.
He was installed on August 11, 1992.
As Bishop, O'Malley first attempted to settle the sexual abuse scandal in the Fall River diocese.
In the Palm Beach diocese (2002-2003), Bishop O'Malley also tried to overcome the abuse scandal there.
He also worked closely with the Portuguese and Hispanic population, which make up a large percentage of the Catholics in the United States.
In 1998 John Paul II appointed O'Malley to the Special Assembly for Oceania of the Synod of Bishops.
Known as a fixer in various Roman Catholic dioceses plagued by sexual abuse scandals, he became the Archbishop of Boston in 2003, succeeding Cardinal Bernard Law who had resigned as a consequence of the sexual abuse scandal there.
Pope Benedict XVI elevated O'Malley to the rank of Cardinal-Priest in the consistory of March 24, 2006.
O'Malley was assigned the titular church of Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome.
The following May, O'Malley was named as a member of both the Congregation for the Clergy and the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in the Roman Curia.
In late September 2009, he became a member of the Presidential Council of the Pontifical Council for the Family, on the same day as an American couple and a professor of law at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, were named as consultors.
On September 19, 2006, O'Malley became the first cardinal with a personal blog.
As of Christmas 2006 he began offering a regular podcast as well.
He views the podcasts as "yet another tool [he] can use to reach the young people in our Church who more and more are turning to the Internet for their information."
O'Malley participated in the 2013 papal conclave, which elected Pope Francis, and is eligible to participate in future papal conclaves that are held before his 80th birthday on June 29, 2024.
As of September 2011, O'Malley is the only Capuchin member of the College of Cardinals.
On April 13, 2013, he was appointed to a group of eight cardinals established by Pope Francis exactly a month after his election, to advise him and to study a plan for revising the Apostolic Constitution on the Roman Curia, "Pastor bonus".
The group's first meeting was scheduled for October 1–3, 2013.
The Pope was already in contact with the members of this group.
Along with former Washington, DC, Archbishop Theodore McCarrick, O'Malley accompanied Francis to Cuba on September 20, 2015.
O'Malley praised the new tone of Francis' papacy.
He stated however that those that expected change in doctrine from the pope on sexual ethics like abortion, contraception, and gay marriage would be disappointed.
He also indicated that the church would not alter the ban on communion for the divorced remarried and that he saw no theological justification for doing so.
On January 14, 2017, Pope Francis named O'Malley to serve as a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (the CDF; formerly, the Holy Office), which is for a five-year renewable term.
In June 2010, after the Ryan Report and Murphy Report on the abuses by the Church in Ireland, O'Malley was named along with others to oversee the apostolic visitation of certain dioceses and seminaries in Ireland.
O'Malley was named as the Visitor to the Archdiocese of Dublin and its suffragan sees, Ferns and Ossory and Kildare and Leighlin.
He would report back to the Holy See on what steps had been taken since the reports were issued, and what else needs to happen.
In November 2007, O'Malley said that the Democratic Party has been persistently hostile to pro-life groups and that the fact many Catholic voters support Democratic candidates "borders on scandal."
In a November 2008 interview he said that, unless the Church formally excommunicated them, he would not deny Communion to Catholic politicians in his diocese who support legal abortion.
Despite criticism from conservative Catholics, including Raymond Arroyo of Eternal Word Television Network, of his participation in the funeral service for Senator Ted Kennedy, a long-standing supporter of legal abortion, O'Malley assisted at the funeral Mass and led a prayer.
He called for less contentious political dialog: "We will not change hearts by turning away from people in their time of need and when they are experiencing grief and loss."
He said he appreciated the Senator's work for social justice, but that "there is a tragic sense of lost opportunity in his lack of support for the unborn".
On October 1, 2009, O'Malley wrote a letter on behalf of the Committee on Clergy, Consecrated Life and Vocations of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR), then under investigation by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, praising a traveling exhibition that documented the work of women religious in the United States.
He wrote that "the Church is grateful for all that your communities have done and continue to do to advance the mission of the Church, especially in the areas of health care, education, social services, and pastoral ministry, as are highlighted in the exhibit".
O'Malley has settled 101 abuse claims and has initiated a zero tolerance policy against sexual abuse.
He also instituted one of the first comprehensive sexual abuse policies in the Roman Catholic Church.
On December 5, 2013, O'Malley announced a pontifically approved commission, the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors whose purpose is to prevent clerical sexual abuse and to help victims.
In 2015, he supported the film "Spotlight", which took an in-depth look at the wrongdoings of the Catholic Church in light of sexual abuse scandals.
O'Malley's stance towards handling sex abuse came under question in July 2018, when it was revealed that the cardinal neglected a letter which Boniface Ramsey, a New York priest, sent to him on June 17, 2015, concerning sex abuse committed by Cardinal Theodore McCarrick.
Despite being required to enforce a zero-tolerance policy with regards to reporting sex abuse, O'Malley said the letter was handled by staff and was never forwarded to him.
Ramsey stated that he had reported the allegations against McCarrick to other Catholic officials before he sent his letter to O'Malley.
During the time the letter was sent, McCarrick and O'Malley were both working with Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega to mend the long-strained relations between the United States and Cuba.
McCarrick also accepted O'Malley's invitation to appear at the Archdiocese of Boston's "Celebration of the Priesthood" fundraising dinner which took place in South Boston in September 2015.
On August 10, 2018, allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced in the Archdiocese of Boston's St. John's Seminary in Brighton, Massachusetts.
On August 15, 2018, it was announced that O'Malley would not attend the World Meeting of Families held in Dublin, Ireland between August 21 and August 26 in order to review these allegations.
In 2009, Caritas Christi Health Care, which the Archdiocese of Boston owned, proposed contracting with Centene Corporation, a Missouri-based health insurer, to provide certain healthcare services, including abortion and pregnancy termination services, through a jointly-owned venture named Celticare.
The new director of Caritas, Ralph de la Torre, announced the project as part of an effort to relieve the hospital system's financial problems while extending services to low income and underserved populations.
In order for Caritas to participate in the Massachusetts state program CommonwealthCare, Caritas needed to provide access to mandated services, including some forbidden by Catholic teaching.
Torre explained: O'Malley asked the National Catholic Bioethical Center to review the contractual relationship, which theologians in a survey conducted by "The Boston Globe" in March had unanimously supported on the grounds that Catholic hospitals would not participate directly in providing abortion and the arrangement would allow Caritas to deliver much-needed services to the poor.
The Catholic Action League of Massachusetts criticized the arrangement: "With Caritas Christi now thoroughly embedded in the culture of death, we are now facing the end, in Massachusetts at least, of Catholic medical resistance to abortion and contraception.
This tragic state of affairs is the personal responsibility of the Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean O'Malley."
In June 2009, Caritas Christi, at O'Malley's insistence, terminated its partial ownership of Celticare.
O'Malley said: Pro-life activist groups varied in their responses.
Some praised O'Malley's decision, but others continued to object that Caritas, as a participant in CommonwealthCare, is still required, even as it refuses to provide abortions, to engage in abortion referrals.
Massachusetts has included sexual orientation in its anti-discrimination statute since 1989, and it legalized same-sex marriage beginning May 17, 2004.
Between about 1985 and 1995, Catholic Charities of Boston, which accepted state funds in support of its adoption services program, placed 13 children with gay couples out of 720 adoptions.
Catholic Charities President J. Bryan Hehir explained the practice: "If we could design the system ourselves, we would not participate in adoptions to gay couples, but we can't.
We have to balance various goods."
In December 2005, the lay-dominated board of Catholic Charities of Boston voted unanimously to continue gay adoptions.
On March 10, 2006, after unsuccessfully seeking help from Governor Mitt Romney in obtaining an exemption from the state's anti-discrimination statute, O'Malley and leaders of Catholic Charities announced that the agency would terminate its adoption work effective June 30, rather than continue to place children under the guardianship of homosexual couples.
Hehir said "This is a difficult and sad day for Catholic Charities.
We have been doing adoptions for more than 100 years."
Suomalainen Kirjakauppa (meaning 'Finnish bookshop') is the largest bookshop chain in Finland, with its flagship branch in Helsinki being Finland's largest bookshop.
It was founded in 1912 and expanded to become Finland's largest bookshop chain in the 1990s.
In May 2017 it consists of 55 shops selling books, office supplies and art materials.
It is owned by Otava Group.
Nigeria Airways Ltd., more commonly known as Nigeria Airways, was a Nigerian airline.
The company was founded in 1958 after the dissolution of West African Airways Corporation (WAAC).
It held the name WAAC Nigeria until 1971, when it was rebranded to the name it had until it ceased operations in 2003.
The government of Nigeria owned a majority of the airline (51%) until 1961, when it boosted its participation in the company to 100% and made it the country's flag carrier.
At the time of dissolution, the airline's headquarters were at Airways House in Abuja.
Operations were concentrated at Murtala Muhammed International Airport and served both domestic and international destinations mainly concentrated in West Africa; the network also had points in Europe, North America and Saudi Arabia.
The airline was managed by a number of foreign companies, including British Airways, the Dutch company KLM and South African Airways.
Nigeria Airways had its heyday in the early 1980s, just before the departure of a KLM team that had been hired to make the airline efficient and profitable.
At that time, its fleet consisted of about 30 aircraft, but the carrier was two years behind with its accounts to the extent that aircraft were acquired for cash.
Owned or leased, the carrier operated a variety of aircraft during its history, including the Airbus A310, the Boeing 737, and the Douglas DC-10, of which it flew the last one ever built.
Plagued by mis-management, corruption, and overstaffing, at the time of closure the airline had debts totalling , a poor safety record, and its operative fleet comprised a single aircraft flying domestic routes as well as two leased aircraft operating the international network.
Nigeria Airways was succeeded by Virgin Nigeria, and the ground facilities were taken over by Arik Air.
The airline came into being on under the name "West African Airways Corporation Nigeria Limited (WAAC Nigeria)", also known as "Nigerian Airways", to succeed the folded West African Airways Corporation (WAAC); the title “WAAC” was retained due to the prestige this company had previously earned.
Initially, the carrier was a tripartite entity in which the Nigerian government was the major shareholder (51%), and Elder Dempster Lines and BOAC held the balance (32⅔ and 16⅓, respectively).
WAAC Nigeria inherited some aircraft previously owned by WAAC.
Operations started on , with a BOAC Stratocruiser operated on behalf of the new airline linking London with Lagos, and DC-3s flying domestic services and a run to Dakar, the last one in conjunction with Ghana Airways.
On the same day, WAAC Nigeria signed a 15-year agreement with BOAC to charter Stratocruisers and Britannias for serving long-haul flights between Nigeria and the United Kingdom.
The contract also contemplated that these routes would be operated in a pool agreement, whereby tickets could be issued by one airline for flights operated by the other, with the revenues being shared.
At , the fleet comprised one Dove, eight Herons and eight DC-3s.
In early 1961, Nigeria became the only owner of the company by buying the shares held by BOAC and Elder Dempster; the airline became the flag carrier of the country.
The entire Heron fleet was withdrawn from service in March 1961 as it proved economically inviable.
Aimed at replacing the DC-3 fleet, five Fokker Friendship 200s were ordered late that year, with options being taken on two more.
A BOAC Comet 4 inaugurated the jet services between Nigeria and London on ; the flight was operated in conjunction with Nigeria Airways.
The Friendships joined the fleet between January and May 1963, and were deployed on regional routes, including those that served Abidjan, Accra, Bathurst, Dakar, Freetown and Robertsfield.
The contract with BOAC was revised and a new agreement was signed in April of the same year.
By June, the DC-3s had begun to be replaced by the Friendships on routes to Gambia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Leopoldville.
However, the type would continue to be deployed on the Kano–Cotonou–Lomé–Accra passenger service and the Lagos-Kano freighter route.
BOAC subsequently operated Vickers VC-10 services on behalf of Nigeria Airways from April 1964 until an aircraft of the type was acquired from the British state airline in ; the airplane was destroyed in an accident in November that year.
The first air link between Nigeria and the United States was launched in early .
Called ″Operation Fantastic", it linked Lagos with New York and was operated by PanAm using Boeing 707s and DC-8s, but an agreement between both countries allowed Nigeria Airways to sell a limited number of seats on these flights.
The number of employees was 2,191 at .
At this time, the fleet comprised one Aztec, one DC-3 and six Fokker F27s that worked on a domestic network and regional routes that extended west, as far as Dakar, operated in a pool agreement with Ghana Airways; the European list of destinations included Frankfurt, London, Madrid and Rome, all of them served with VC10s chartered from BOAC.
On , the company was rebranded as "Nigeria Airways".
At this time the airline used aircraft leasing as a common practice: Boeing 707s that flew the Lagos–London route were leased from Laker Airways and Ethiopian Airlines until a new Boeing 707-320C was incorporated into the fleet and deployed on the route in August 1971, and in October 1971 a Boeing 737 was leased from Aer Lingus.
Another Boeing 707-320C was ordered in 1972, along with two Boeing 737-200s.
A Boeing 707 was leased from Aer Lingus in April 1972 for deployment mainly on the Lagos–London route, with the provision of crew and maintenance.
In October 1972, a Fokker F28 entered the fleet on a lease agreement with Fokker, and later on aircraft of this type were ordered.
In late 1972, a contract for management assistance was signed with TWA, with the American carrier providing specialists in different managerial, commercial, and financial fields for five years, but the contract was never excersised.
Nigeria Airways took delivery of three Boeing 707s in February 1973; they were put into service on the Lagos–London run immediately.
Two Boeing 737s, with registrations 5N-ANC and 5N-AND, were delivered in the early 1970s.
At the workforce was 2,400 strong and the fleet consisted of two Boeing 707-320Cs, two Boeing 737-200s, three Fokker F28s, five Fokker F27s, and one Aztec, while five F28-2000s were on order.
The route network at this time comprised domestic destinations served from Kano and Lagos, and international routes to Abidjan, Amsterdam, Accra, Bathurst, Beirut, Brussels, Dakar, Douala, Frankfurt, Freetown, London, Madrid, Monrovia, New York, Paris and Rome.
In , the company became the 83rd customer for the Boeing 727, when an order for two Boeing 727-200s and another Boeing 707-320C was placed; it also took possession of a Douglas DC-10-30.
This DC-10 was a 300-seater, all-economy aircraft that operated between Nigeria and Saudi Arabia.
At this time the carrier took possession of two more 707s.
A second DC-10-30 was ordered in early 1977.
On 25 April 1977 an F-27, 5N-AAW, had an accident in Sokoto when it overran the runway, and on 1 March 1978 an F-28 (5N-ANA) had a fatal accident near Kano, killing all 16 occupants of the aircraft plus two more people on the ground.
An order for two F28-4000s, that would complement the six F28-2000s the airline had in operation, was placed in late 1978.
A contract similar to the one signed with TWA in 1972 was signed with KLM in , this time for a period of two years.
It was mostly aimed at training Nigeria Airways' employees in airline management in order to make the airline efficient and profitable.
A service to Jeddah was launched in 1980.
By , the fleet consisted of 26 aircraft, split into three Boeing 707-320Cs, two Boeing 727-200s, two Boeing 737-200s, two DC-10-30s, two F27-200s, two F27-400Ms, four F27-600s, six F28-2000s, two F28-4000s, and one Aztec.
The two DC-10s were purchased for cash.
Nigeria Airways became Airbus' 40th customer in 1981, when it placed an order for four Airbus A310-200s.
Four new Boeing 737-200s were ordered in early 1981 for including spare parts, and late that year an order for four more aircraft of the type was placed.
In 1982, Boeing 747s were successively leased from the Danish charter airline Scanair and SAS; the aircraft were deployed on services to the United Kingdom, permitting the DC-10s to be used on new routes to Frankfurt, Paris, and Zurich.
The airline took possession of four new Boeing 737-200s in early 1983 that would replace leased aircraft of the same type; they were acquired with a loan of  million that was arranged with seven major banks.
On 28 November 1983, a Fokker F28 (5N-ANF) crashed while on approach to Enugu, claiming 23 lives from the 72 people on board.
Following this accident the carrier decided to withdraw its Fokker fleet from service.
A military coup d'état that took place in the last day of 1983 changed the structure of the government and the airline: Bernard Banfa was appointed managing director and many of the staff trained by KLM were dismissed.
The 225-seater A310-200s were incorporated into the fleet in late 1984 and early 1985.
Three of these aircraft bore the names "Rima River", "River Ethiope" and "Lekki Peninsula".
The fleet was 22 strong in , comprising two DC-10-30s, four Airbus A310s, three Boeing 707-320Cs, two Boeing 727-200s, ten Boeing 737-200s, and one Boeing 737-200C; two Boeing 737-200s were on order and the carrier had 9,096 employees at this time.
The introduction of International Monetary Fund policies, along with corruption, mismanagement and overstaffing, led to a steady decline of Nigeria Airways from the 1980s.
The carrier had accumulated significant debts that outstripped its revenues from the mid-1980s, to the extent that aircraft were detained or impounded for unpaid debts.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) suspended Nigeria Airways in early 1987 from the clearing house (which meant the airline could not issue tickets to fly on other IATA member airlines and the converse) for accumulated debts of .
In late 1987 the airline had debts for approximately , with a revenue of per month and expenditure of approximately a month.
This situation prompted the airline to increase its domestic and international fares by 100% and 20%, respectively, in order to raise funds to alleviate the deficit, but this measure reduced the passenger traffic.
Even though 1,000 jobs had been cut by late 1986 and 1,700 in the course of the previous year, Nigeria ordered the airline to further downsize (the number of employees was 8,500 at the time—or 500 for each aircraft in the fleet, twice the international average—) and to reduce or discontinue unprofitable routes.
In 1988, cost-cutting measures led to the discontinuance of flights to a number of African destinations, including Cotonou, Dakar, Douala, Kinshasa, Monrovia and Nairobi, and to the transfer of some routes to the privately owned airline Okada Air; some of these routes were resumed a year later.
In December 1988 the airline dismissed 3,000 employees, a third of the workforce, in an effort to keep operations afloat.
In the late 1980s the airline lost a deposit worth for not firming up an order for six ATR-42s.
Financed by a Japanese leasing company, the carrier phased in the last DC-10 ever built; the aircraft was delivered in 1989, and replaced an aircraft of the same type that was lost in an accident two years earlier.
With a payroll of 6,632 at March 1990, the airline had a fleet of three Airbus A310-200s, three Boeing 707-320Cs, eight Boeing 737-200s and two DC-10-30s.
A large domestic network serving the 19 Nigerian states was operated, as well as routes to East and West Africa; intercontinental flights from Lagos to Amsterdam, Jeddah, London, New York and Rome, from Kano to Amsterdam, Jeddah, London and Rome, and from Port Harcourt to London were also undertaken.
The carrier suffered a major accident on 11 July 1991, when all 261 people on board a Douglas DC-8-61, registration C-GMXQ, crashed near Jeddah.
In 1992, Nigeria Airways had three Boeing 707s impounded in Europe, and the number of flights experienced a 32% reduction following the termination of services to Conakry, Freetown and Robertsfield (Monrovia).
Privatisation was first considered in 1993 with a proposal to split Nigeria Airways in two companies, one bearing the same name and operating domestic routes and a new one named Air Nigeria, which would undertake the international operations.
In July 1994, an Airbus was impounded at London Heathrow Airport owing to a debt worth ₤100,000.
On 21 December of the same year, a Boeing 707, registration 5N-ABK, crashed near Hadejia on a freighter flight from Jeddah, killing three of a crew of five.
Further staff reductions continued throughout the first half of the 1990s, and at September 1995 the airline had 4,500 employees.
In 1997 the UK Civil Aviation Authority banned the airline from operating into its territory citing safety concerns; in return, the Nigerian government barred British Airways from operating in the country.
The service was restored in 1998 when the carrier began codesharing with British Airways, deploying a leased Boeng 747-200 that wore a Nigeria Airways livery and was operated on the Lagos–London Heathrow route with mixed English and Nigerian crews.
By the late 1990s, the Nigerian government decided the carrier would be privatised by selling 40% and 20% to foreign and local investors, respectively, and keeping the rest of the shares.
In 1999, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) was commissioned by the Nigerian government to assist in the process of restructuring and privatisation of the airline.
Among three options, one of them was to partner with a large European airline; Air France, British Airways, German-based Lufthansa, Swissair and the British carrier Virgin were all considered.
Another alternative was to liquidate the carrier.
At April 2000, the number of employees was 4,516.
At this time, an Airbus A310-200, three Boeing 737-200 Advanced, one Boeing 747-200B Combi and one McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 served a route network that included Abuja, Calabar, Douala, Dubai, Jeddah, Jos, Kaduna, Kano, Kinshasa, Lagos, Libreville, London, Maiduguri, Malabo, Port Harcourt, Sokoto and Yola.
A fleet that had numbered 32 aircraft in 1984 had gradually reduced to just three aircraft in October 2000.
The United Kingdom cited safety concerns again in 2001 when it refused to allow Nigeria Airways to operate the Lagos–London route, this time regarding the Boeing 747 that was leased from Air Djibouti to fly the route.
That year, the IFC withdrew from its advisory position citing the unwillingness of both the company and the government to carry out the necessary measures that would make the airline attractive to potential investors.
Later on, there were various allegations claiming the airline's failure was accelerated by former Nigerian rulers who looted and mismanaged the company, to the extent that the government started an investigation into the disappearance of more than  million between 1983 and 1999.
Launched in February 2001, a joint venture between Nigeria Airways and South African Airways that mostly relied upon the Johannesburg–Lagos–New York route was unilaterally terminated by the South African carrier in March 2002 citing a decline in passenger numbers and a deficit of .
In May 2003, when Nigeria Airways had a Boeing 737-200 as its sole serviceable aircraft, the government decided not to pump more money into the overstaffed carrier but to liquidate it.
The decision was based on the declining performance of the airline's last 15 years of operations and on the carrier's debts.
The number of carried passengers had fallen from 2,1 million in 1985 to just 10,000 in the first quarter of 2003, and it controlled just 6% and 1% of the domestic and the international markets, respectively.
The carrier owed over  million, despite the government having injected  million into the company in its last decade of operations.
The airline ceased operations in 2003 and was liquidated a year later.
The Nigerian government later came to an agreement with Virgin Atlantic Airways to found Virgin Nigeria Airways, intended as a replacement.
Even though Virgin Nigeria succeeded Nigeria Airways, the ground facilities of the folded Nigeria Airways were eventually taken over by the then-startup carrier Arik Air.
Nigeria Airways had its headquarters at Airways House in Abuja at the time of dissolution.
It had been moved from Murtala Muhammed Airport between 1999 and 2000.
The airline logo consisted of the Nigerian flag with a green elephant named "Skypower" in its centre.
At the time of closure the Nigeria Airways network consisted of four domestic destinations, namely Abuja, Kano, Lagos and Port Harcourt.
The international network comprised five routes, to Abidjan, Dubai, Jeddah, London and New York.
The following aircraft types were operated by Nigeria Airways during the course of its history: Aviation Safety Network records 16 events for the airline, eight of which led to fatalities.
The worst accident experienced by the carrier took place on , when 261 people were killed in an accident at King Abdulaziz International Airport.
The following list includes events that had reported fatalities, there was a hull-loss of the aircraft involved, or both.
Ozyorsk or Ozersk is a Closed city in Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia.
The population was: The town was founded on the shores of Lake Irtyash in 1947.
Until 1994, it was known as Chelyabinsk-65, and even earlier, as Chelyabinsk-40 (the digits are the last digits of the postal code, and the name is that of the nearest big city; which was a common practice of giving names to closed towns).
Codenamed City 40, Ozersk was the birthplace of the Soviet nuclear weapons program after the Second World War.
In 1994, it was granted town status and renamed Ozyorsk.
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with six rural localities, incorporated as the Town of Ozyorsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.
As a municipal division, the Town of Ozyorsk is incorporated as Ozyorsky Urban Okrug.
Ozyorsk was and remains a closed town because of its proximity to the "Mayak" plant, one of the sources of Soviet plutonium during the Cold War, and now a Russian facility for processing nuclear waste and recycling nuclear material from decommissioned nuclear weapons.
The plant itself covers an area of approximately 90 km² and employs about 15,000 people.
The "Mayak" is primarily engaged in reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel from the nuclear submarines and icebreakers and from nuclear power plants.
Commercially, it produces cobalt-60, iridium-192, carbon-14 and establishes conversion production with use of radiative technologies applying wasteless technologies.
The town's coat of arms depicts a flame-colored salamander.
Southern-Urals Construction Department is another major enterprise.
Its activities include construction for atomic industry needs, production of concrete constructions and construction materials.
Main products of Plant of Wiring Products #2 are low-voltage devices for military-industrial establishments.
Ozyorsk along with Richland, Washington, were the first two cities in the world to produce plutonium for use in cold war atomic bombs.
The Chelyabinsk region has been reported as being one of the most polluted places on Earth, having previously been a center of production of weapons-grade plutonium.
Ozyorsk and the surrounding countryside have been heavily contaminated by industrial pollution from the Mayak plutonium plant since the late 1940s.
The Mayak plant was one of the largest producers of weapons-grade plutonium for the Soviet Union during much of the Cold War, particularly during the Soviet atomic bomb program.
Built and operated with great haste and disregard for safety, between 1945 and 1957 the plant dumped and released large amounts of solid, liquid and gaseous radioactive material into the area immediately around the plant.
Over time, the sum of radionuclide contamination is estimated to 2-3 times the release from the explosions from the Chernobyl accident.
In 1957, the Mayak plant was the site of a major disaster, among all the other such accidents, releasing more radioactive contamination than Chernobyl, again.
An improperly stored underground tank of high-level liquid nuclear waste exploded, contaminating thousands of square kilometres of territory, now known as the Eastern Ural Radioactive Trace (EURT).
The matter was quietly and secretly covered up, and few either inside or outside Russia were aware of the full scope of the disaster until 1980.
Before the 1957 accident, much of the waste was dumped into the Techa River, which it severely contaminated as well as residents of dozens of riverside villages such as Muslyumovo, who relied on the river as their sole source of drinking, washing and bathing water.
After the 1957 accident, dumping in the Techa River officially ceased, but the waste material was dumped in convenient shallow lakes near the plant instead, of which 7 have been officially identified.
Of particular concern is Lake Karachay, the closest lake to the plant (now notorious as the most contaminated place on Earth) where roughly 4.4 exabecquerels of high-level liquid waste (75-90% of the total radioactivity released by Chernobyl) was dumped and concentrated in the shallow lake over several decades.
In addition to the radioactive risks, the airborne lead and particulate soot levels in Ozyorsk (along with much of the Ural industrial region) are also very high—roughly equal to the levels encountered along busy roadsides in the era predating unleaded gasoline and catalytic converters—due to the presence of numerous lead smelters.
While the environmental impact of the disaster was immense, the contamination of the local populace was equally devastating.
The average person living in Ozyorsk, 8 km from the Mayak Nuclear Facility, had a long term radioactive burden on their body at 17 Bq.
Because of the large amounts of radioactive materials that were discharged into the atmosphere, over twenty two small towns throughout the region were evacuated.
Some cities took two years for a full evacuation to take place.
Reports indicated that humans living in the affected area during the time that the disaster took place and their offspring have developed problems with reproductive functions, mortality, age structure, and gender deformities.
These populations were recorded at experiencing a radioactive exposure of 40-500 mSV.
There are seventeen different cultural and public-service institutions.
There are sixteen secondary schools, two schools specializing in the English language, one gymnasium, physics-mathematics lyceum, three professional colleges, Southern-Ural Polytechnical College, Music College, Ozyorsk Engineering Institute (an affiliate of National Research Nuclear University MEPhI), and affiliates of Yekaterinburg's and Chelyabinsk's universities. "City 40" is a documentary film about the town, by Samira Goetschel, released in July 2016.
The "Cockney School" refers to a group of poets and essayists writing in England in the second and third decades of the 19th century.
The term came in the form of hostile reviews in "Blackwood's Magazine" in 1817.
Its primary target was Leigh Hunt, but John Keats and William Hazlitt were also included.
Only Keats could properly be regarded as a cockney.
Hazlitt was not even born in London.
John Scott died after a duel over the controversy.
Each of the writers was derided for a slightly different quality.
Keats, for example, was accused of "low diction" for rhyming "thorns/fawns" in "Sleep and Poetry" and other rhymes which suggested a working class speech.
Hunt and Hazlitt were similarly vilified for their diction, but the criticisms were more ideological with them than with Keats.
John Wilson Croker perpetuated the term "Cockney School" beyond the pages of "Blackwood's" in 1818 when he attacked Keats's "Endymion" in the "Quarterly Review."
The term, and the campaign against Hunt and the others, was not a question of aesthetics.
It was, instead, an attack on the class background of the authors and their aspirations to the highest level of the literati, and it was, additionally, a reaction to the "Cockney" politics of the authors.
The political, reformist agenda and the democratic ideology of Hunt and Hazlitt were offensive to the "Blackwood's" review staff, and the cultural and class background of the authors was introduced as a mechanism.
Percy Bysshe Shelley was accused of being similarly offensive politically, but the reviewers excused him for his genius (and, of course, his high birth).
The second generation of the Romantic movement was as politically and economically revolutionary as it was aesthetically challenging to the "status quo," and the controversy and partial reviewers responsible for the creation of the "Cockney School" epithet foreground how offensive it was to the establishment that lower class persons might emerge.
According to the 1907 "Nuttall's Brief Encyclopedia," the term was revived in the 1890s by working class London poets, but, although this may have been "en vogue" at the turn of the twentieth century, the term is currently remembered for the Romantic reference only.

According to the , it has a population of people.
The municipality is known as the home of Mount Madia-as, an enchanted mountain sacred to ancient Visayans as it is home to the god of death, Sidapa, boy-god of the moon, Bulan, and god of meteors, Bulalakaw.
During the Spanish colonial times, Culasi was known by its old name "Bacong".
Now, Bacong is only one of its barangays.
Bacong was one of the four "visita"s or towns established by the Spaniards.
The others were Nalupa (now Barbaza), Bugason (now Bugasong), and Hamtik (now Hamtic).
The name "Culasi" or "Kulasi" was derived from the local term for a species of mangrove "Lumnitzera racemosa" which grow abundantly in the vicinity's river basin.
The 1905 census revealed that Culasi had the biggest Chinese population in Antique, so much so that it had a barrio named "Villa de Hong Kong" in their honor.
It is now part of the Poblacion.
Culasi is located at .
It is north from San Jose de Buenavista, the capital of Antique, and south from Kalibo, the capital of Aklan.
According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the has a land area of constituting of the total area of Antique.
Located in the northern portion of the province, it is bounded on the north by Sebaste, south by Tibiao, west by the Sulu Sea and east by Mount Madja-as and the Municipality of Madalag, Aklan, just beyond.
Its territory includes Maniguin (or "Maningning" / "Hammerhead") and Batbatan Islands.
Excluding the outlying islands, its northernmost point is located at 11°32’05" latitude and 122°05’00" longitude.
Its easternmost point is located at 11°30’50" latitude and 122°10’05" longitude.
Its southernmost point is located at 11°21’04" latitude and 122°02’08" longitude and the westernmost point is at 11°31’05" latitude and 122°03’08" longitude.
Culasi has a slope of 8°.
Eastern height ranges from to at the summit of Mount Madia-as, it is the highest point in Panay.
It has unbroken mountain range from barangay Batonan Sur in the south to barangay Salde in the northernmost.
From the peak of Madia-as Mountain it gradually flattens down to a narrow strip of the coastal plain.
Land area roughly covers 82.92% upland and above lowland comprises 17.08% of the land area with a slope of 18% and below.
Forest areas comprise almost half of the total land area covering .
Culasi has two distinct seasons, the rainy and dry.
Rainy season occurs in the months of May to November and dry season for the rest of the year.
Areas like the mountainous barangays of Flores and Osorio located at the southern portion of the municipality are characterized by a relatively cool temperature which is highly suited for coffee.
The higher precipitation acquired may be caused by high mountain range or because of its high topography.
Culasi is politically subdivided into 44 barangays, which are classified into 3 island, 11 upland, 16 coastal and 14 interior/lowland barangays.
In the , Culasi had a population of .
The population density was .
Farming and fishing are the major livelihood where the Culasinhon depend their living.
The rolling hills of Mount Madja-as are rich in manganese, copper and coal found in Timbaban.
Other metallic mineral deposits are white clay and pebbles in the island barangays of Malalison and Batbatan.
Sand and gravel is being extracted in various rivers and used for infrastructure.
Another metallic mineral is the limestone deposit found in Sitio Bula, Camancijan and is used for agricultural and industrial purpose.
Limestone is used in the production of cement.
Most treasured one is the oil deposit in Maniguin Island explored by the Philippine National Oil Corporation (PNOC).
Several companies drilled oil deposit in Maniguin with black coal.
Maniguin has a potential reserve of 28 million barrels to 250 mmbbls. based on the PNOC drilling project report.

Echinerpeton is an extinct genus of synapsid, including the single species Echinerpeton intermedium from the Late Carboniferous of Nova Scotia, Canada.
Along with its contemporary "Archaeothyris", "Echinerpeton" is the oldest known synapsid, having lived around 308 million years ago.
It is known from six small, fragmentary fossils, which were found in an outcrop of the Morien Group near the town of Florence.
The most complete specimen preserves articulated vertebrae with high neural spines, indicating that "Echinerpeton" was a sail-backed synapsid like the better known "Dimetrodon", "Sphenacodon", and "Edaphosaurus".
However, the relationship of "Echinerpeton" to these other forms is unclear, and its phylogenetic placement among basal synapsids remains uncertain. "Echinerpeton" is known from six specimens, five housed in the Museum of Comparative Zoology and a sixth in the Redpath Museum: the holotype MCZ 4090, which consists of a partial postcranial skeleton and some jaw fragments; MCZ 4091, which includes vertebrae and an interclavicle; MCZ 4092, a left maxilla or upper jaw bone; MCZ 4093, a partial right maxilla; MCZ 4094, including three neural arches or vertebral spines; and RM 10057, consisting of a right maxilla, neural arch, rib, and a phalanx or finger bone.
Since all other specimens besides the holotype are isolated bone fragments, their assignment to the same species is not certain.
The maxillae are distinct in having straight lower margins, distinct from the often curved jaws of ophiacodontids and sphenacodontids but similar to the straight jaws of some other synapsids like "Archaeothyris", "Haptodus", and "Varanops".
The dentary or lower jaw bone has a slight upward curve.
The teeth of both the upper and lower jaws are small and cone-shaped, some having slightly serrated edges, and are only differentiated by slight differences in length (some other synapsids have teeth that vary greatly and shape across their jaws).
The three forward-most dentary teeth are angled slightly outward as in more derived synapsids such as "Dimetrodon" and "Sphenacodon".
Several features, including straight-margined maxillae and simple conical teeth, are also seen in the earliest reptiles. 23 presacral (neck and back) vertebrae are preserved in the holotype, although several may be missing because the typical number of presacral vertebrae in early synapsids is 27.
The centra or centers of the vertebrae are slightly compressed, similar to the compression seen in the vertebrae of ophiacodontids.
There are large spaces between the centra where bones called intercentra could fit, although no intercentra are preserved in the six "Echinerpeton" specimens.
The loose connection between the centra and intercentra is one of the primitive features of "Echinerpeton", since other early synapsids have intercentra that fit tightly with the centra as part of an evolutionary progression toward completely fused vertebral elements.
The most prominent feature of the vertebrae of "Echinerpeton" are their tall neural spines, which can be up to seven times higher than they are wide.
They are similar in proportion to the spines of "Sphenacodon", although "Echinerpeton" is considerably smaller in overall size.
The neural spines of the holotype are thinnest at their tips, suggesting that MCZ 4090 may have been an immature individual with poorly ossified bones.
By contrast, MCZ 4094 has neural spines that are thicker at their tips and are slightly larger in size, both of which are possible indications that the specimen represents an adult individual.
The first vertebra preserved in the series, the axis bone, has a neural spine that is low and broad like those of many other synapsids.
The axis is most similar to those of ophiacodontids because it widens toward the top, and unlike those of sphenacodontids which widen about midway up the spine and then narrow at the top.
To either side of the neural spines are smaller transverse processes, which have struts of bones extending from them that were described as a "webbing."
This "webbing" helps connect the vertebrae to the ribs, and is otherwise only seen in ophiacodontids.
Parts of the appendicular skeleton (limbs, hips, and shoulder bones) are preserved in "Echinerpeton" specimens, including the interclavicle, scapula (shoulder blade), the lower portion of the humerus (upper arm bone), the illium (a hip bone), the upper portion of the femur (upper leg bone), the tibia and fibula (lower leg bones), astragalus and calcaneum (ankle bones), and metatarsals (foot bones).
The illium of "Echinerpeton" is similar to those of early reptiles in that it is narrow and backward-pointing, while those of sphenacodontids are widened at their front to support the hip's connection with the sacral vertebrae.
The astragalus has the same simple L-shape as those of ophiacodontids.
Reisz (1972) tentatively classified "Echinerpeton" as an ophiacodontid in its initial description, and in 1986 he considered it an indeterminate "pelycosaur".
Lee (1999) argued that the placement of "Echinerpeton" within Synapsida was not certain because it lacked any of the defining features or synapomorphies present in the group, all of which come from the skull.
He claimed that all the features linking "Echinerpeton" with synapsids were also present in other basal amniotes, so it could not be placed definitively on the synapsid branch of Amniota (the other amniote branch is Sauropsida, or reptiles).
Benson (in press) was the first to include "Echinerpeton" in a phylogenetic analysis, and considered it a "wildcard taxon" because it had three equally likely positions on the synapsid tree: one as the most basal synapsid, another as the sister taxon of a clade containing Caseasauria, Edaphosauridae, and Sphenacodontia, and a third as an ophiacodontid more derived than "Archaeothyris".
Benson also found that the inclusion of "Echinerpeton" in his analysis was causing large polytomies, or unresolved relationships, in the strict consensus tree.

John Harris (Harrys) (c.1588–1658) was an English academic and clergyman.
He was Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford, long-time Warden of Winchester College, and a member of the Westminster Assembly.
He was born at Hardwicke, Buckinghamshire, about 1588, the son of Richard Harris, rector of Hardwicke.
After being educated at Winchester College, where he entered as a scholar in 1599, he was Fellow (1606–1622) of New College, Oxford, and proceeded M.A. on 23 January 1611.
He gained a high reputation as a Greek scholar and preacher, particularly with Henry Savile who compared him only with John Chrysostom.
In 1617 he was elected one of the university proctors and in 1619, being then B.D., was appointed regius professor of Greek.
He resigned his professorship in June 1622, receiving various prebends.
In May 1628, being then D.D., he obtained the rectory of Meon-Stoke, Hampshire.
In September 1630 he was elected Warden of Winchester College, where he built Sickhouse, founded in 1640 on the site of the old Carmelite friary, built by 1656.
During the First English Civil War he sided with the presbyterians, and was chosen one of the assembly of divines.
He took the covenant and other oaths, and so kept his wardenship; it helped that he was on good terms with Nathaniel Fiennes.
Winchester had a parliamentary visitation in 1649, a powerful group headed by three regicides in Henry Mildmay, John Lisle, and Nicholas Love, with the lawyer Robert Reynolds; but Harris gave an adequate account of the College and its functions, and no changes of personnel or statutes ensued.
He died at Winchester on 11 August 1658, aged 70, and was buried in the college chapel.
He wrote a biography of Arthur Lake, prefixed to Lake's "Sermons" (1639).
Letters to William Twisse, with Twisse's answers, were published by Henry Jeanes (1653).
The Republican Party of Angola - Conservative Party an anti-corruption political party in Angola that strongly opposes the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which has ruled the country since 1975.
The party was founded in 1994 in Massachusetts, United States of America.
Its permanent headquarters in Luanda, Angola.
After the 2008 parliamentary elections, the first time in 17 years that Angola went to the polls, the MPLA-government proposed that presidential elections be held in September 2009.
Earlier that year the MPLA's leader, José Eduardo dos Santos, declared that the approval of a new constitution was the highest priority for his party.
In his New Year's address, Dos Santos also stated that his party will propose, through its parliamentary members, the creation of an “ad hoc” committee in the National Assembly, which would be in charge of preparing the new draft constitution and “promoting, whenever appropriate, a broad discussion [of the draft] before approval by the Parliament”.
Dos Santos did not mention the future presidential election, and in so doing fueled rumors that the Angolans will not return to the polls in 2009, as they had expected.
There has been a range of speculation on Angloan blogs and media about the reasons behind this.
Carlos Alberto Contreiras Gouveia, PREA's president said that the MPLA are facilitating the constitutional amendment process to perpetuate Dos Santos' presidential power by an indirect-electoral process that violate the constitution.
In Aug 2009, the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has urged Angola to hold credible elections. "We look forward to Angola building on this positive step by including adopting of a new constitution, investigating and prosecuting past human rights abuses and holding timely, free and fair elections," Mrs Clinton said.

Tullio Cianetti (20 August 1899, in Assisi – 8 April 1976, in Maputo, Mozambique) was an Italian fascist politician who was well known for his work with the trade unions.
The son of a farmer, Cianetti was conscripted in 1917 and served as a lieutenant in the Italian Army until 1921.
Returning to Assisi, he worked as a teacher, whilst also helping to found the fascio in the town, becoming secretary in 1922.
He was moved to Terni to organise the syndicate before being promoted to captain and appointed regional secretary for syndicates in Umbria in 1924.
The same year he stepped away from fascism for a time following the death of Giacomo Matteotti and suspicion began to arise that he was too left-wing.
However, by 1925 he had returned as secretary of syndicates in Syracuse, before being promoted to major and going on to hold similar roles in Carrara, Messina, Matera and Treviso.
In 1931 he was promoted to colonel and made secretary of the national federation of miners and quarrymen and in this role agitated for higher wages.
However, despite his tendency to sometimes clash with the government he continued to rise in influence, serving as secretary of the Fascist Confederation of Industrial Workers' syndicates and Vice-President of the Institute of Social Assurance.
As head of the Confederation, Cianetti concluded a deal with Robert Ley in 1937 to allow Italian workers to go to Nazi Germany for employment.
Such was the regard with which he was held by the leaders of the German Labour Front that the main Volkswagen factory even had a leisure complex called Cianetti Hall in his honour.
Cianetti's rise continued when he was promoted to general and appointed to the Fascist Grand Council in November 1934, and in 1939 was made undersecretary of corporations.
He reached his zenith in April 1943 when he was promoted to marshal and became Minister of Corporations.
However his dissident tendencies continued as Cianetti voted in favour of Dino Grandi's motion to remove Mussolini, after Grandi had told him that all he was doing was arranging for the king to share the burden of government with Mussolini.
Cianetti wrote to "Il Duce" to apologise immediately afterwards.
Cianetti was one of the fascists tried along with Galeazzo Ciano in the Verona trial of 8–10 January 1944, although of all the defendants he was the only one spared execution, sentenced instead to thirty years imprisonment.
The letter of apology he had written to Mussolini saved him from the death penalty.
Following the liberation he escaped imprisonment and went into exile in Mozambique.

Princeton Municipal Airport is a city-owned public-use airport located one nautical mile (1.85 km) southwest of the central business district of Princeton, a city in Mille Lacs County, Minnesota, United States.
This airport is included in the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems 2015-2019, which categorizes it as a "general aviation airport".
Although most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, this airport is assigned PNM by the FAA but has no designation from the IATA.
The Federal Aviation Administration relocated the flight service station (FSS) for Minnesota to Princeton in 1987.
The airport was completely renovated in 1988.
Princeton Municipal Airport covers an area of at an elevation of 980 feet (299 m) above mean sea level.

"I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love" is a hit song written by Diane Warren and Albert Hammond for the group Chicago and recorded for their album "Chicago 19" (1988), with Bill Champlin singing lead vocals.
It is the first Chicago single to feature Champlin performing all lead vocals himself.
The first single released from "Chicago 19", it reached number three on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100 chart.
The B-side of the single was "I Stand Up" written by Robert Lamm and Gerard McMahon.
The song was featured in the Netflix original movie "Death Note", which is based on the anime of the same name.
Andrew of Rhodes (Andrew of Colossus; died 1440) was a Greek Dominican theologian.
He was Greek by birth, and born to Eastern Orthodox parents.
In early youth he had no opportunities for education, but afterwards devoted himself to Latin and Greek, and to theology, especially the questions in dispute between the Latin and Greek Churches.
The study of the early Fathers, both Greek and Latin, convinced him that in the disputed points, truth was on the side of the Latin Church.
He therefore solemnly abjured his error, made a profession of faith, and entered the Dominican Order about the time of the Western Schism.
He led thenceforth an apostolic life.
He was especially earnest in his efforts to induce his fellow-Greeks to follow in his footsteps and reunite with Rome.
In 1413 he was made Archbishop of Rhodes.
The Dominican biographer, Jacques Échard, credits him with having taken an active part in the twentieth session of the Council of Constance (1414–18).
Others maintain that there is here a confusion with Andrew of Colaczy, in Hungary.
At the Council of Basle, he delivered an oration in the name of the Pope (Mansi, XXIX, 468–481).
He took part in the Council of Ferrara-Florence, and was one of the six theologians appointed by the papal legate, Cardinal Julian, to reply to the objections of the Greeks.
He proved that it was fully within the province of the Church to add the Filioque clause to the Creed, and that the Greek Fathers had been of the same opinion.
After the close of the Council, trouble arose between the Latins and Greeks in Cyprus; the latter accused the former of refusing to hold communion with them.
Andrew was sent thither by Pope Eugene IV, and succeeded in establishing peace.
He also succeeded in overcoming the local forms of the Nestorian, Eutychian, and Monothelite heresies.
The heretical bishops abjured and made a profession of faith at a synod held at Nicosia; some of the prelates went afterwards to Rome to renew their profession before the Holy See.
There are preserved in the Vatican manuscript copies of his treatise on the Divine essence and operation, compiled from the commentaries of St. Tomas Aquinas, and addressed to Cardinal Bessarion also a little work in the form of a dialogue in reply to a letter of Mark of Ephesus against the rites and ceremonies of the Roman Church ("Patrologia Graeca", CL, 862).
Ritten is a "comune" (municipality) in South Tyrol in northern Italy.
The community is named after the high plateau, elevation , the Ritten or the Renon, on which most of the villages are located.
The plateau forms the southeast tip of the Sarntal Alps mountain range and is located between, and on average above the rivers Eisack and Talfer.
Ritten lies directly northeast of Bolzano, settled on the "meeting point" of the above rivers.
Ritten borders the following municipalities: Barbian, Bolzano, Kastelruth, Karneid, Völs, Jenesien, Sarntal and Villanders.
As of 31 December 2016, Ritten had a population of 7,847.
There are 17 fraziones (subdivisions, usually consisting of one or a few villages and hamlets).
These include the central village Klobenstein (Collalbo), in which the townhall is located, as well as Atzwang (Campodazzo), Gissmann (Madonnina), Lengmoos (Longomoso), Lengstein (Longostagno), Mittelberg (Monte di Mezzo), Oberbozen (Soprabolzano), Oberinn (Auna di Sopra), Rotwand (Pietrarossa), Siffian (Siffiano), Signat (Signato), Sill (Castel Novale), Unterinn (Auna di Sotto), Wangen (Vanga), and Wolfsgruben (Costalovara).
Of these only Atzwang and Sill are not located on the plateau, but on the rivers Eisack and Talfer, respectively.
The mountain ridge is first mentioned in AD 871–75 as "Mons Ritanus" and then in 1027 as "Mons Rittena".
Already around 1200 a mountain inn was established on the plateau.
In 1237 Runkelstein Castle was built on a rocky spur in Ritten territory by the lords of Wangen.
The Tyrolean patriotic hero Peter Mayr (1767–1810), involved in the rebellion against Napoleon's forces that occupied Tyrol, was born in the village of Siffian in Ritten.
From the 17th century Ritten has been a popular summer destination for citizens of Bolzano, since the air is considerably cooler on the plateau.
Ritten is connected with Bolzano with a provincial road and with a cableway from Oberbozen, one of the longest cableways of the world in one track, about long and 12 minutes to travel.
This cableway replaced in 1960 the previous rack railway, built in 1907.
The railway is still in function on the mountain side between Maria Himmelfahrt and Klobenstein.
The official community coat of arms consists of gules two chevrons embowed argent; it is the arms of the Lords of "Zwingenstein" who ruled the village from their castle until 1531.
The emblem was adopted in 1967.
The candy company Loacker is based in Ritten.
According to the 2011 census, 95.20% of the population speak German, 4.55% Italian and 0.25% Ladin as first language.
The Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society, Inc., or LASFS, is a science fiction society that meets in the Los Angeles area.
The current meeting place can be found on the LASFS website.
LASFS is the oldest continuously operating science fiction club in the world, helped considerably in that record by being one of the few to own a clubhouse.
The organization continues to hold regular weekly meetings on Thursdays.
The club maintains a private lending library of books, videos, and other genre-related materials, for use by members.
Members of the club have run the World Science Fiction Convention several times, initiated the regional science-fiction convention Westercon, and hosts a yearly science fiction convention called Loscon.
It maintains a web site and discussion forum, publishes (at irregular intervals) an amateur magazine called "Shangri L'Affaires", and hosts the collations of a weekly amateur press association, APA-L.
The LASFS monthly newsletter, "De Profundis", is named for the club motto, "De Profundis ad Astra" ("From the Depths to the Stars"). "DeProf" is available (in PDF format) for reading at the LASFS web site, and can be obtained by writing its editor/publisher, Marty Cantor.
In 1934 Hugo Gernsback, editor of the then-prominent science fiction magazine "Wonder Stories", established a correspondence club for fans called the "Science Fiction League."
Local groups across the nation could join by filling out an application.
Early meetings were held first at the Pacific Electric Building, then moved to Clifton's Cafeteria.
Forrest J Ackerman later wrote, "The first meetings of the club were held in what was called the Pacific Electric Building in downtown Los Angeles.
I think that once a month, a man who worked there was able to get the seventh or eighth floor free for us.
Then we moved to Clifton's Cafeteria, a feature of which was their free limeade and lime juice.
Some of the members who didn't have more than a nickel or dime to spend guzzled a lot of that free juice.
By 1936, the League had begun to fail.
New management was less interested in the League, and the members grew up and lost interest.
Charter group number four, in Los Angeles, had an active member in Forrest J. Ackerman, who missed the first few meetings (he was living in San Francisco with his parents), but whose enthusiasm and imagination provided a focus for the group. "Forry" and a cadre of other members kept it alive as the science fiction and fantasy genres developed.
Local authors (and sometimes those from out of the area) also helped by coming to meetings from time to time.
In 1939, the group broke with the Science Fiction League, changed its name to the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society, and begun to meet every Thursday.
In this decade, the club began publishing the fanzine "Shangri L'Affaires".
Nicknamed "Shaggy", the zine has died and been revived many times over the decades.
When published now, it is photocopied, but originally it was done on a mimeograph machine.
One of the ways to earn your dues was to crank the machine and collate the sheets.
World War II was a very busy time for the club, though few major changes were made.
Most members were either below or well above draft age, and many fans from around the country visited en route to the war in the Pacific.
Some moved to Los Angeles to work in defense industries.
In the 1940s, some members such as Ray Bradbury began writing professionally, and an increasing number of professional science fiction authors visited meetings or joined as "Members at Large" elsewhere in the world.
For some years, the club sponsored "Fanquets" for members who had made their first professional sale.
In the 1950s, the club became embroiled in controversy, partly from taking the stand that if they didn't address controversies, they would fade away.
Ackerman was still the mainstay of the club in the first part of the 1950s, but marriage and work needs led to his attending less frequently.
One of the live wires of the club at this time was Bjo Trimble, a former WAVE who met her husband John under Ackerman's piano (at a crowded party).
In the 1960s the club continued to grow, with the effects of the counterculture of the 1960s adding new members from the surrounding suburbs of Southern California.
Many members became fans of the newly created "" television show, and in 1968 Trimble and other members of LASFS were instrumental in organizing a nationwide letter writing campaign which saved the show from its announced cancellation by NBC at the end of its second season.
The club's meeting place (called 'Freehafer Hall' by the members after member Paul Freehafer) was usually in a public meeting hall and so it would be forced to relocate from time to time.
Over the decades it moved from central Los Angeles further west until it reached Santa Monica, "as far west as it could go and remain dry."
In 1964, member Paul Turner made what seemed to some like a frivolous suggestion, to others a brilliant idea: that the LASFS establish a building fund, generated from weekly meeting dues and fund-raising events such as auctions, with the idea of eventually purchasing its own permanent clubhouse.
Members quickly began taking the idea seriously, and by the late 1960s, after a period of hesitation, Bruce Pelz became the building fund's most fervent supporter.
In 1973, less than 10 years after its inception, the LASFS building fund had enough money in the bank to purchase a small private residence on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City and convert it into the weekly meeting hall.
By 1977, the club needed a newer, larger clubhouse, and so it sold the Ventura Boulevard property and purchased a property at 11513 Burbank Boulevard, about two blocks west of Lankershim Blvd in North Hollywood, with two buildings: Freehafer Hall (the rear building), and "Building 4SJ" (fronting the Street).
Building 4SJ was named after Forrest J Ackerman, and contained the society's lending library, furnished rooms for socializing, and a pay telephone.
On September 1, 2011, the organization moved to a new building in Van Nuys, which formerly housed a cabinet-making shop and a poker school.
As of early 2018, while a more permanent location is being sought, the meetings are being held in a temporary location: Null Space Labs, 10717 Chandler Blvd. (rear), North Hollywood 91601, from 6:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. As of August 2, 2018, the location is the American Lutheran Church, 755 North Whitnall Highway, Burbank, CA 91505.
The Treasurer is elected once a year; the other club officers are elected twice a year.
The Board of Directors is elected on a staggered basis: 4, 4, and 3.
For the current list of officers and directors, please see the Contact LASFS page.
Advisors to the Board: Charles Lee Jackson II, June Moffatt, Fred Patten.
In the Hugo-nominated science fiction novel "Fallen Angels" by LASFS members Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (with Michael Flynn), LASFS' unofficial motto ""Death Will Not Release You"" and its even more unofficial countersign ""... even if you die"" play a pivotal role in plot development.
As of 2003, the village had an estimated population of 2,091 and a density of 15.60 persons per km².
The total area was 134.04 km².
On March 6, 2005, Asahi, along with the towns of Susa and Tamagawa, and the villages of Fukue, Kawakami and Mutsumi (all from Abu District), was merged into the expanded city of Hagi.
Jason was a Norwegian whaling vessel laid down in 1881 in Rødsverven, Norway, the same shipyard which later built Ernest Shackleton's ship "Endurance".
The ship, financed by Christen Christensen, an entrepreneur from Sandefjord, was noted for her participation in an 1892-1893 Antarctic expedition led by Carl Anton Larsen.
The vessel reached 68°10'S, and set a new record for distance travelled south along the eastern Antarctic Peninsula.
The ship's first mate during the expedition was Søren Andersen, also of Sandefjord. "Jason" was sold to an Italian company in 1899 and rechristened "Stella Polare".
In 1888, Fridtjof Nansen captained "Jason" to Greenland in order to attempt the first documented crossing of the island.
From 1892 to 1894, the ship was used on scientific whaling expeditions to the Antarctic, funded by A/S Oceana.
The purpose of these expeditions were to map the presence of whales and seals in the area.
During this mission, "Jason" achieved a record of going the longest south in the area, reaching 68°10'S.
In 1898 the Italian prince and explorer Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi wanted to do polar expeditions.
He travelled to Norway and consulted the famous polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen that had sailed the furthest north with the Colin Archer built polar ship "Fram" in 1893-96.
In 1899 Amedo bought "Jason," renamed her "Stella Polare" and took her to Colin Archer's shipyard.
The interior was stripped out and beams, diagonals and knees heavily strengthened the ship.
At the same time, Colin Archer fitted out "Southern Cross" for polar expeditions and the two ships lay side by side at the yard in Larvik.
Amedeo gathered an expeditionary crew of Italian and Norwegian civilians and sailed from Christiana on 12 June of that year.
By the 30th, they had reached Archangel, Russia to load sled dogs onto the ship.
Leaving Russia, they headed for Franz Josef Land.
They landed in Teplitz Bay in Rudolf Island, with a hope to establish a winter camp for the expedition.
From here, they established a string of camps designed to supply each other with food and men.
During the expedition, Amedeo lost two fingers to frostbite, and had to hand command of the voyage over to Captain Umberto Cagni.
On 25 April 1900, Cagni planted the Italian flag at 86°34'N, claiming the title of "Farthest North."
Amedo's uncle was murdered and the widow made a silver replica of "Stella Polare" at a cost of 12.000 lire and placed it at the virgin Marias wonder working picture in the cathedral of Torino, Italy.
In July 1909 the "Stella Polare" was given as training ship for an association in Rome.
She was taken under tow from the arsenal in Spezia and anchored at Ripa Grande in river Tiber, a little upstream of the Aventinerhights.
There she caught fire, but a part of the bow was saved and put in the museum of Milano.

Nicholas Brown Sr. (July 26, 1729 – May 29, 1791) was a Providence, Rhode Island merchant, civic leader and co-signer of the charter of the College of Rhode Island in 1763.
In 1771, Nicholas Brown Sr. was instrumental in convincing Baptist authorities to locate a permanent home for the College in his hometown of Providence.
In 1804, the College was renamed Brown University following a gift made by Brown's son Nicholas Brown Jr. Born in 1729, the second child of James Brown II (1698–1739) and Hope Power Brown (1702–1792), Nicholas Brown Sr. was apprenticed to his uncle Obadiah Brown (1712–1762) from the age of 16.
Just before his 21st birthday, his older brother Captain James Brown (1724–1750) died at sea.
Nicholas took his role as head of the family very seriously, delaying his marriage to Rhoda Jenckes (1741–1783) until he was 33 years old.
Following the death of his uncle Obadiah, the family business conglomerate that included maritime trade along the Eastern Seaboard, with the Caribbean and with England; a rum distillery; spermaceti candle manufacturing; an iron foundry (the Hope Furnace); and a network of shops, was renamed Nicholas Brown & Co. Until 1771, Brown worked in partnership with his three younger brothers Joseph (1733–1785), John (1736–1803), and Moses (1738–1836), who were known in Rhode Island annals as the "Four Brothers."
Thereafter, the brothers continued to collaborate on ventures but were no longer partners.
Brown served in the Rhode Island Legislature and became a civic leader, funding or fundraising for the paving of Providence streets, a library, a market house, the College of Rhode Island's first building, the First Baptist Church, a fire engine and other civic improvements.
During the Revolution, he speculated in war bonds, supplied the Continental Army with gunpowder and foodstuffs, transformed the Hope Furnace into cannon works, and funded several privateering ventures.
During the post-war "critical period," Brown was a leader of the Federalist faction in Rhode Island that opposed paper money and supported ratifying the U.S. Constitution.
Shortly after taking over the family business, Brown ordered a nine-and-a half foot mahoganny desk-and-bookcase crafted by the John Goddard workshop of the Newport, Rhode Island.
It was sold for his descendant, Nicholas Brown VI by Christie's Auctioneers on June 3rd, 1989 for $12,100,000, the highest price ever paid for a piece of decorative art at that date, to fund the restoration of the Nightingale-Brown House, which today is the John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage at Brown University.
Following Rhoda Brown's death in 1783, Brown remarried Avis Binney (1749–1807).
He fathered ten children with Rhoda and one with Avis, of which only two survived: a son Nicholas Brown Jr. (1769–1841) and a daughter, Hope (1773–1855) who married Thomas Poynton Ives (1769–1835).
When Brown died in 1791, the Rev.
Dr. Stillman of Boston gave a eulogy: He was the affectionate husband, the tender father, the compassionate master, the dutiful son, the loving brother, and the steady, faithful friend.
He took much pains, by reading and by conversation, to inform his mind, and had acquired much general knowledge.
But religion was his favorite subject.
To Christianity in general, as founded on a fulness of evidence, and to its peculiar doctrines, he was firmly attached. * * * He was a Baptist from principle, and a lover of good men of all denominations.
Blessed with opulence, he was ready to distribute to public and private uses.
In his death the college in this place, this church and society, the town of Providence, and the general interests of religion, learning, and liberality have lost a friend indeed.
As head of the family business, Nicholas Brown Sr. made a number of controversial decisions regarding smuggling, attempting to corner the tobacco market in Surinam, rigging elections, and most notably attempting a slave trading voyage in 1764 to fund his new iron foundry.
The disastrous 1764 voyage of the "Sally" is described in detail in the final report of Brown University's Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice.
Thereafter, Brown never again attempted slave trading and ensured his son was mentored by George Benson, an ardent abolitionist.
Windsor Thomas White (August 28, 1866 – April 9, 1958) was an American automobile developer.
A native of Orange, Massachusetts, he produced the White steamer cars in 1900, and later expanded to trucks.
These vehicles were used militarily during World War I.
White, along with two of his brothers Rollin White and Walter, were inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1997.
He was the father of polo player Windsor Holden White.
Salvia namaensis is an evergreen perennial shrub native to a limited area in Namibia and a wide area of South Africa (the Cape Provinces and the Free State).
It is typically found growing on rocky slopes, shales, limestone hills, and sandy soils at 1,000 to 5,000 feet elevation.
The specific epithet "namaensis" probably refers to the Nama tribe which is indigenous to Namaqualand, the region in Namibia where the plant grows. "Salvia namaensis" is a slightly woody shrub that reaches 3 feet tall and wide.
The small leaves (0.75 inch) are irregular and pinnatifid, giving the plant an airy appearance.
The leaves are yellow-green, along with the new stems and calyx.
The short inflorescences, about 4 inches long, have 2 to 6 flowers growing in each whorl.
Flowering is typically light, with white or very pale blue corollas that are about 0.6 inches long.
There are reportedly some that have mauve flowers.

Curtis Jonathan Hussey (born July 22, 1981) is an American professional wrestler.
He is currently signed to WWE performing on the Raw brand under the ring name Fandango.
He is currently inactive due to a torn labrum in his left shoulder, which will require surgery.
Hussey began his professional wrestling career in 1999.
He worked for several promotions beginning in September 1999.
He competed in several Independent promotions in New England, winning the PLW New England Championship, the PWF Northeast Tag Team Championship with Kenn Phoenix on more than one occasion, the PWF Northeast Heavyweight Championship, NCW New England Championship, the Tag Team Championship with Damian Houston, and the SCCW Lightweight Championship.
In 2006, Hussey signed a development contract with World Wrestling Entertainment and was assigned to Deep South Wrestling (DSW), WWE's developmental territory.
He was then moved to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) in June 2008, where he won the Florida Tag Team Championship on more than one occasion with Tyler Reks and Derrick Bateman.
In December 2010, he competed in the fourth season of "NXT" as Johnny Curtis, and he eventually won the competition in March 2011.
In 2013, Hussey re-debuted as Fandango.
In April 2013, WWE audience members started singing and dancing to his entrance music, which rose substantially on the iTunes charts and generated coverage in mainstream media.
Hussey trained under Killer Kowalski and debuted in September 1999.
He wrestled for various independent promotions in the New England area over the next few years.
He competed in Power League Wrestling (PLW) from 2000 until 2003, during which time he won the PLW New England Championship.
He held the championship, after defeating Chris Blackheart at Power-fest 2002, from May 19, 2002 until May 18, 2003.
He also competed in the Premier Wrestling Federation during this time, and he teamed with Kenn Phoenix to win the PWF Northeast Tag Team Championship from Fuzion (Mike Paiva and Blade) on October 28, 2002.
They held the championship until November 15, when they were defeated by Paiva and Kid Mikaze.
Now known as The Talent Exchange, Hussey and Phoenix won a three-way Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match to win the championship again on February 15, 2003.
They held the championship until April 4, when Phoenix and Dean Ripley, The Talent Exchange's manager (who had been forced to participate in the match instead of an absent Hussey), lost the championship to the Storm Brothers.
He also wrestled for NWA: Total Nonstop Action (NWA-TNA), Chaotic Wrestling, and NWA Wildside.
In 2006, Curtis signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and was subsequently assigned to the Deep South Wrestling (DSW) developmental territory.
Curtis made his debut for the territory on November 9, where he lost to David Heath.
After losing consistently over the next several weeks, Curtis scored his first victory in DSW as he and Robert Anthony defeated The Headliners (Shawn Shultz and Chris Michaels) on February 15, 2007.
Curtis continued to team with Anthony and after winning a few more matches, the team faced the DSW Tag Team Champions Team Elite (Mike Knox and Derick Neikirk) in a match for the championship on March 15, but they were unable to win the title.
Curtis then became a singles competitor once again and after losing two matches, he won his final match in DSW by defeating Frankie Coverdale on April 12.
After WWE severed ties with DSW, Curtis and all the other talent in DSW were transferred over to the newly established Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) in June.
On June 26, Curtis made his FCW debut as he defeated former tag team partner Robert Anthony.
After mixed success as a singles and tag team wrestler, Curtis defeated Chris Gray on December 18 to become the number one contender for the FCW Southern Heavyweight Championship.
On January 8, 2008, he wrestled Ted DiBiase, Jr. for the championship, but lost the match.
On September 18, Curtis made an appearance at the SmackDown/ECW tapings, where he defeated Armando Estrada in a dark match.
On December 11, 2008, Curtis teamed with Tyler Reks to defeat The New Hart Foundation (DH Smith and TJ Wilson) for the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship.
The team of Curtis and Reks proved to be successful, and they retained the championship on several occasions.
After beginning a feud with Caylen Croft and Trent Beretta, Curtis and Reks retained the title against them on a few different occasions before finally losing the title to Croft and Beretta on April 30, 2009 after Curtis didn't appear for the title defense, leaving Reks to wrestle alone.
After Reks was called up to WWE's main roster, Curtis renamed himself Jonathan Curtis and became a villain.
The two then faced off for Reks' Florida Heavyweight Championship on June 25, but Curtis was unable to win the title.
On July 2, Curtis wrestled in a triple threat match for the FCW Florida Championship also involving Alex Riley, what but was again unsuccessful as Reks retained the title.
Soon afterwards, Curtis reverted his ring name to Johnny Curtis.
Beginning in 2010, Curtis began competing at house shows for the Raw brand, with his first match being a loss to Evan Bourne on January 8.
After losing several matches to both Bourne and Paul Burchill at house shows, Curtis wrestled his first dark match, which he lost to Kung Fu Naki on the January 19 episode of "ECW".
On August 12, 2010, Curtis teamed with Derrick Bateman to win the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship by defeating the team of Donny Marlow and Brodus Clay and the defending champions, "Los Aviadores" (Hunico and Epico) in a three-way tag team match.
After a near three-month reign, Curtis and Bateman lost the championship to Wes Brisco and Xavier Woods on November 4.
Curtis was part of the fourth season, with R-Truth as his mentor.
He made his in-ring debut on the season premiere on December 7 episode of "NXT", defeating fellow rookie Jacob Novak in singles competition.
The following week, Curtis was unsuccessful in the "Karaoke" challenge, but was successful in the "Obstacle Course" challenge, earning points towards immunity from elimination.
On the December 21 episode of "NXT", Curtis lost the "Wheelbarrow Race" challenge, and suffered his first loss in a rematch to Jacob Novak.
Curtis was then defeated by pro Dolph Ziggler on the December 28 episode of "NXT", and afterwards won both the "Power of the Punch" challenge and a "Talent Show" contest.
On the January 4, 2011 episode of "NXT", Curtis was defeated in singles competition by Brodus Clay.
It was later revealed that he was immune from elimination that week.
On the next week of "NXT", Curtis lost both the "Slingshot Challenge" and the "Superstar Password" challenge, and competed in singles competition defeating pro Ted DiBiase after a failed interference by his rookie Brodus Clay.
Curtis was unsuccessful in the "How Well Do You Know Your WWE Pro?" challenge on the January 18 episode of "NXT", and was safe from elimination that week.
On the January 25 episode of "NXT", Curtis was unsuccessful in the "Out-think the Fink" challenge, and competed in a fatal four-way match with Brodus Clay, Derrick Bateman, and Byron Saxton with Clay winning the match.

Curtis was then successful in the "Grace Under Pressure Physical" challenge and in a triple threat match against Derrick Bateman and Johnny Curtis.
During the season finale on March 1, Curtis was declared the winner of "NXT", defeating Brodus Clay in the final.
After various dark matches, Curtis debuted on "SmackDown" on the June 3 episode in a bizarre backstage promo where he said that his promised tag team title shot was "not going to happen" in light of R-Truth's recent villainous turn.
He then began to sarcastically cry and proceeded to pour milk onto a plate and then over his head, in reference to the saying "don't cry over spilled milk".
After weeks of backstage promos playing on words, Curtis made his SmackDown in-ring debut on the August 12 episode, being squashed by Mark Henry in less than a minute, which was his only non-battle royal match on SmackDown in 2011.
Curtis then made his return to the fifth season of "NXT" as a heel on November 2.
Curtis turned his attentions to wooing Maxine, whom he had formerly dated, and therefore ignited a feud with Maxine's storyline fiancé, Derrick Bateman.
As the weeks passed, Bateman and Maxine ultimately broke up as Maxine gave a kiss to Curtis on the December 28 episode of "NXT Redemption", thus solidifying their relationship.
On the January 4, 2012, episode of "NXT Redemption", Curtis and Maxine revealed that they would marry in two weeks time in Las Vegas during Bateman's match with Darren Young.
On 100th episode of "NXT", Derrick Bateman interrupted Curtis and Maxine's wedding ceremony.
Derrick showed a clip of Curtis sending a message on Bateman's iPad to Teddy Long (Maxine had dumped Bateman because he had allegedly sent a message to Long saying he didn't need Maxine and wanted to leave her on NXT whilst he had a chance at getting a contract on Smackdown).
Maxine then slapped Curtis and reunited with Bateman once again after finding out that it wasn't true.
Curtis then started to use his new catchphrase "Let's Get Weird" which was also printed on his trunks.
In the next weeks, Maxine dumped Bateman for Curtis again.
On the March 14 episode of "NXT Redemption", Curtis and Maxine were defeated in a mixed tag team match against Derrick Bateman and Kaitlyn, who kissed at the end of the match, solidifying their relationship to the annoyance of Maxine.
After William Regal was appointed as NXT's authority figure, Maxine enlisted Curtis' help to allow her to get close to Regal.
On the March 21 episode of "NXT Redemption", Maxine and Curtis knocked out Matt Striker with chloroform so that Maxine could join Regal on commentary.
However, Striker was then kidnapped (kayfabe) by unknown persons, later revealed to be Curt Hawkins and Tyler Reks, who intended to blackmail Curtis and Maxine into using Maxine's charms to get Regal to leave Hawkins and Reks alone.
Striker was rescued by Bateman and Kaitlyn on the April 11 episode of "NXT Redemption".
On April 18, William Regal forced Maxine to sign a contract as Curtis's manager if the two still wanted to be employed to "NXT" and then handcuffed them together.
On the May 9 episode of "NXT Redemption", Regal allowed Curtis and Maxine to be uncuffed.
For the rest of 2012, Curtis formed an occasional tag team with Michael McGillicutty.
On the final episode of the fifth season of "NXT" on June 13, Curtis teamed with McGillicutty but lost to the Usos.
After the conclusion of the fifth season of "NXT", NXT transitioned into the renamed Florida Championship Wrestling developmental territory.
Curtis continued appearing on "NXT", where at the October 11 tapings (which aired on November 28) Curtis finally received his tag team title shot from winning season four of "NXT", when he teamed up with McGillicutty in a loss to champions Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan).
At the October 23, 2012 "SmackDown" taping, Hussey debuted a new ballroom dancer character named Fandango in a dark match, with vignettes for the character airing by November.
After months of promotional videos, the character of Fandango debuted on the March 1, 2013 episode of "SmackDown".
As part of his act, Fandango was portrayed as fussy, flamboyant, and sultry-voiced.
He was also accompanied by a female dance partner, mostly by a dark-haired and unnamed Andrea Lynn (a real-life dancer and college student) and later Summer Rae, a developmental wrestler.
Despite his debut, Fandango refused to wrestle his first match on numerous occasions because the ring announcers and his opponents could not pronounce "Fandango" to his satisfaction.
On the March 18 episode of "Raw", Chris Jericho mispronounced Fandango's name intentionally and repeatedly to start Fandango's first feud.
Tharwat Okasha (; 1921–27 February 2012) was an Egyptian writer, translator and Minister of Culture during the Nasserite era, Tharwat Okasha, who is referred to as the founder of Egypt's cultural institutions.
Tharwat Okasha was an army officer involved in the Free Officers Movement, along with former president Nasser and his comrades, which toppled King Farouk of Egypt from his crown in what is known as the 23 July Revolution of 1952.
As a child of an aristocratic family, Okasha received a good education, read books in foreign languages, and learned music very early on in his home.
This background made him the most cultured and enlightened officer among his group of army officers.
He was appointed minister of culture in the late 1950s by President Nasser.
Okasha held the position twice from 1958 to 1962 and, again, from 1966 to 1970.
The two terms made him the most prominent minister of culture in Egypt's modern history.
Okasha received his PhD in literature from Sorbonne in the 1960s and worked as visiting scholar at the College De France.
He published more than 70 books, including his three-volume memoir titled "My Memoirs in Politics and Culture", which is considered a rich resource for historians of the Nasserite era; as well as a 38-volume encyclopedia of arts titled "The Eye Listens and the Ear Sees".
During his terms in ministerial posts, he founded many cultural institutions that are still functioning and considered major Egyptian landmarks.
For example, he founded the High Council for Culture and Arts (now called the Supreme Council for Culture), the Egyptian Book Organisation and, most importantly, the Arts Academy.
Okasha had translated books, many, including:
Smith Sound is a sound on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, located to the south of Rivers Inlet and between the Queen Charlotte Strait region (S) and Fitz Hugh Sound (N).
Smith Sound is the traditional home and territory of the Gwa'sala group of Kwakwaka'wakw, who are today organized with the 'Nak'waxda'xw (Nakoaktok) into the Gwa'sala-'Nakwaxda'xw Nations band government.
Indian reserves on Smith Sound and Smith Inlet under their governance are:
In computer science, an interchangeability algorithm is a technique used to more efficiently solve constraint satisfaction problems (CSP).
A CSP is a mathematical problem in which objects, represented by variables, are subject to constraints on the values of those variables; the goal in a CSP is to assign values to the variables that are consistent with the constraints.
If two variables "A" and "B" in a CSP may be swapped for each other (that is, "A" is replaced by "B" and "B" is replaced by "A") without changing the nature of the problem or its solutions, then "A" and "B" are "interchangeable" variables.
Interchangeable variables represent a symmetry of the CSP and by exploiting that symmetry, the search space for solutions to a CSP problem may be reduced.
For example, if solutions with "A"=1 and "B"=2 have been tried, then by interchange symmetry, solutions with "B"=1 and "A"=2 need not be investigated.
The concept of interchangeability and the interchangeability algorithm in constraint satisfaction problems was first introduced by Eugene Freuder in 1991.
The interchangeability algorithm reduces the search space of backtracking search algorithms, thereby improving the efficiency of NP-Complete CSP problems.
Finds neighborhood interchangeable values in a CSP.
Repeat for each variable: The algorithm can be used to explicitly find solutions to a constraint satisfaction problem.
The algorithm can also be run for k steps as a preprocessor to simplify the subsequent backtrack search.
Finds k-interchangeable values in a CSP.
Repeat for each variable: In the case of neighborhood interchangeable algorithm, if we assign the worst case bound to each loop.
Then for "n" variables, which have at most "d" values for a variable, then we have a bound of : formula_1 .
Similarly, the complexity analysis of the "k"-interchangeability algorithm for a worst case formula_2, with formula_3-tuples of variables and formula_4, for formula_3-tuples of values, then the bound is : formula_6.
The figure shows a simple graph coloring example with colors as vertices, such that no two vertices which are joined by an edge have the same color.
The available colors at each vertex are shown.
The colors yellow, green, brown, red, blue, pink represent vertex Y and are fully interchangeable by definition.
For example, substituting maroon for green in the solution orange|X (orange for X), green|Y will yield another solution.
In Computer Science, the interchangeability algorithm has been extensively used in the fields of artificial intelligence, graph coloring problems, abstraction frame-works and solution adaptation.

"The Master, Wardens and Comonalty of the Art or Mistery of Tanners of the Parish of St Mary Magdalen Bermondsey of Surrey" was incorporated by Royal Charter by Queen Anne on 15 July 1703.
Its authority was to check on the quality of tanning within Bermondsey and an area of thirty miles from it and to apprentice suitable persons to qualify as tanners to a Master i.e. member of the Company.
It is therefore a guild.
Its practical authority and control of the trade was abolished by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 but it remained a membership organisation and was largely an association of the leading Bermondsey tanning firms throughout the 19th Century, they created the Leather Market.
The London Leather Exchange and gentlemen's club on Weston Street buildings still extant.
These were the families of Bevington, Gale, Barrow, Hepburn and Enderby, among many others.
Although the last remnant of the leather trade in Bermondsey was lost in 1990 when Barrow & Gale, the makers of the Maundy Money Purses and Red Boxes, relocated to Peckham, the guild remains to conduct its educational activities through making educational and training bursaries, gifts and prizes to local youth and other worthy causes.
The Master, Upper Warden and Other Warden are elected and sworn into office "on 24th June or fourteen days thereafter" by and from the Court of Assistants who number between 14 and 24 members.
The Clerk is meant to be 'learned in the Law'; the senior members do not wear gowns but Tanned Leather Aprons.
This is done after a Thanksgiving Service in the ancient guild church of St Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey and is followed by a procession along Bermondsey Street to the Leather Exchange were a feast is held.

Dr. Gerald A. Soffen (February 7, 1926 – November 22, 2000), known as Jerry or Gerry, was a NASA scientist and educator who served in a wide variety of roles for the space agency, primarily dealing with either education or with life sciences—especially the search for life on Mars.
He earned his A.B.S. from the University of California, Los Angeles, his M.S.
from University of Southern California, and his Ph.D. in Biology from Princeton University.
He pursued his postdoctoral work at New York University.
Working from NASA's Langley Research Center in the mid- to late-1970s, Dr. Soffen was project scientist for the NASA's Viking program of Mars landers, the first successful missions to perform unmanned experiments on the surface of the planet.
In that role, he oversaw all scientific investigations conducted by the landers, coordinating the work of more than seventy scientists around the nation.
In 1977 he appeared on an episode of the popular television series "In Search Of" entitled "Martians" and he spoke about the Viking's findings up to that time. "We have started what will become an adventure of mankind in searching for not only the lower forms of life but also the search for intelligent life.
This is one of the milestones in the course of human destiny to find cousins."
Soffen also predicted that mankind would eventually colonize Mars by using Planetary Engineering.
Later, he would become NASA Langley's Chief Environmental Scientist, leading work on remote sensing by satellite as well as laboratory experiments, ground-based measurements, and theoretical models.
After concluding his work with Viking, Soffen became the director of Life Sciences at NASA Headquarters in 1978.
In this position, Dr. Soffen was responsible for the agency-wide program to monitor and maintain the physical well being of NASA astronauts in space, as well as the Biomedical Program, the Space Biology Program, and the Exobiology (also sometimes called the Astrobiology) program.
In 1983, Soffen transferred from NASA Headquarters to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland.
Initially, his role at GSFC focused on establishing the "Mission to Planet Earth" program; Soffen also served as the project scientist for NASA's Earth Observing System as that program was starting.
In the 1990s, though, Soffen's focus would shift to education.
In 1990, Soffen lead the formation of the University Programs office at GSFC, an office he would manage for several years.
Three years into that role, Soffen created NASA Academy, NASA's premiere leadership training internship.
From 1990-92 he served on the Science Advisory Committee for Biosphere 2.
Dr. Soffen has been memorialized in several ways by his peers and former students.
The "Dr. Gerald A. Soffen Memorial Fund for the Advancement of Space Science Education" was established by the NASA Academy Alumni Association "to continue Jerry's commitment to the future of space by supporting motivated students in the fields of space science and engineering".
The "Gerald Soffen Memorial Panel/Lecture" is also a feature of the annual Space Studies program conducted by International Space University.
Additionally, a crater on Mars was recently named "Soffen".
The crater is centered at 23.73 degrees S, 140.86 degrees E on Mars.
The Viking 2 lander was also posthumously named after Dr. Soffen.
Javerlhac-et-la-Chapelle-Saint-Robert is a commune in the Dordogne department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in southwestern France.
Javerlhac is in the Parc naturel régional Périgord Limousin.
The Bandiat river flows near the settlement of Javerlhac.
The two parishes and communes of Javerlhac and La Chapelle-Saint-Robert were united in 1823.
In the last century, a railway line ran between Nontron (the sub prefecture) and Angoulême in the Charente via Javerlhac.
Although the rails have long since been removed and bridges demolished, part of the permanent way beginning approximately 6 kilometers from Javerlhac towards Angoulême (Charenet region) has now been converted to a cycle and horse-riding path and is also used by walkers.
This track has been surfaced with asphalt but is blocked to motor vehicles and in some cases bridges have been restored or replaced to keep the path intact.
Some of the station houses along the line still remain and have been converted for various purposes.
The old station house in Javerlhac is still standing and in good repair.
It is now used as the fire brigade station for the part-time fire service.
Firefighters are summoned by a siren which is situated on the town hall and controlled by the mayor's office.
In summer months the siren can be heard almost daily as hay barns and hay ricks catch fire.
The siren is tested every Sunday at midday.
The road leading to the old station from Place du 8 Mai 1945, is still called Avenue de la Gare.
The château de Javerlhac dates back to the 15th century and has a water mill for the making of nut oil.
La Chapelle-Saint-Robert dates back to the 12th century, it features a Romanesque building which classifies as a historic monument.
Close to the Mayor's office and post office there is a monument dedicated to members of the community who died in both World Wars.
About 5 kilometers from Javerlhac on the road to Angoulême, there are 3 small memorials to members of the resistance who were shot by the Nazis in World War II.
Just opposite the old church there is a mill on the river Bandiat which is still in working order although only to show tourists how it was in former days.
In the grounds of the mill there is a dovecote which is still used by a number of pigeons.
The painter Fernand Desmoulin (1853–1914) lived in the village of Javerlhac.
Javerlhac, like most of the surrounding towns and villages is host to a small population of expatriate British families, mostly retired couples.
There is also a small number of Irish and a few Dutch expatriates in the area.
This is noticeable in the advertisements by some estate agents in the area where a lot of their publications and adverts are in English.

The Amazon Conservation Team (ACT) is a non-profit organization that works in partnership with indigenous people of tropical South America in conserving the biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest as well as the culture and land of its indigenous people.
ACT was formed in 1996 by ethnobotanist Dr. Mark Plotkin and Costa Rican conservationist Liliana Madrigal, and so far has mainly been active in the northwest, northeast, and southern regions of the Amazon.
In 2002, ACT received the United Nations Environment Programme Global 500 Award in recognition of their conservation achievements.
In 2008, the organization received the Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship from the Skoll Foundation.
In November 2010, ACT was recognized as a 2010 Tech Awards Laureate by the prestigious Tech Museum in San Jose, for their work with technology to help map the Amazon.
In 2015, ACT received the 'Seeing a Better World' Award from DigitalGlobe, a leading provider of high resolution satellite imagery, aerial photos and geospatial content.
In its efforts to achieve the land protection objectives of its indigenous partners, ACT employs a stepped procedure: first, participatory ethnographic mapping and ethno-environmental diagnostics are conducted; second, ACT helps the tribes/communities develop management plans that embrace both land protection and sustainable development; and third, ACT provides conservation and land monitoring capacity building to the tribes/communities while bringing their representatives in communication with state environmental enforcement agencies.
To this last end, ACT conducts an annual indigenous park ranger training program certified by the International Ranger Federation.
Areas ethnographically mapped by ACT in collaboration with local tribes include Brazil’s 2,800,000-hectare Xingu Indigenous Reserve, its 248,000-hectare Suruí Indigenous Reserve, and its 4,000,000-hectare Tumucumaque Indigenous Reserve.
The Suruí Reserve mapping was facilitated by technical assistance from Google Earth Outreach, which also trained the tribe in remote monitoring.
Since its inception, ACT has worked with tribal groups in the Colombian Eastern Andes (Cofan, Inga, Siona, Kamsá, and Coreguaje) and the interior of Suriname (Trio, Wayana) in an attempt to preserve, strengthen and perpetuate their traditional healthcare systems, including their legacy ethnobotanical knowledge.
The effort emphasizes intergenerational transmission of knowledge from elders to youth.
In Suriname, ACT has constructed four traditional medicine clinics in interior communities (Kwamalasamutu, Tepu, Apetina, and the Maroon village of Gonini mofo) operated by local healers and their apprentices.
In 2003, this effort was selected among a handful of global initiatives for the UNESCO/Nuffic publication “Best Practices Using Indigenous Knowledge”.
In 2004, ACT's integrated medicine project received a World Bank Development Marketplace Award, the first such award made for a Suriname-based initiative.
In the Colombian Amazon, ACT helped establish the Association for Indigenous Woman of Traditional Medicine (ASOMI), today composed of 75 traditional healers, and supports the organization’s cultural education program, reaching 140 students.
ACT is assisting the National Park Service of Colombia in the development of protection guidelines and contingency plans for isolated indigenous communities in Colombian National Parks, with particular reference to the Rió Puré and Cahuinarí National Parks in the department of Amazonas, where ACT sponsored overflights in 2010 and 2011 that identified the longhouses of uncontacted peoples, likely the Yuri (Carabayo) or Passé people, long believed extinct.
In Colombia, ACT partnered with the government and local tribes to establish two protected areas that both create new categories of reserve: The 77,000-hectare Alto Fragua Indi Wasi National Park (Caquetá Department), the first reserve to be co-managed by a resident tribe (the Inga) and the national park service; and the 10,000-hectare Orito-Ingi Ande Medicinal Plant Sanctuary (Putumayo Department), the first reserve specifically created for the conservation of medicinal flora.

It is a small tree, growing 10–15 m tall.
The leaves are spirally arranged, lanceolate, 6–8 cm long on mature trees, larger, to 15 cm long and 2 cm broad, on vigorous young trees.
The seed cones are highly modified, with a single 2 cm diameter seed with a thin fleshy coating borne on a short peduncle.
The pollen cones are 1.5-2.5 cm long, solitary or in pairs on a short stem.
The Archdiocese of Gdańsk is an archdiocese located in the city of Gdańsk in Poland.
According to the church statistics Sunday mass attendance was 38.1% in 2013 making it lower than the Polish average of weekly mass attendance (39.1%) After World War I the Free City of Danzig was split from Germany according to the Treaty of Versailles.
The Catholic congregation West of the Vistula belonged to the Diocese of Chelmno, which was formerly also part of the German Empire but after 1919 part of the Second Polish Republic and East of the Vistula to the Diocese of Ermland, which remained part of Weimar Germany.
Germans within the administration of the Diocese of Chelmno were replaced by Polish priests and the Polish language was implemented as binding.
While about 130,000 people in Danzig were Catholic, only about 10 percent of them were Polish-speaking and the first attempts to reorganize the ecclesiastical allocation were made in spring 1919, when members of the German congregation asked for an affiliation to the Diocese of Ermland.
While these attempts were supported by the German government, the Polish government tried to preserve the current situation.
Pope Pius XI decided to establish an "Apostolic Administrator of the Free City of Danzig" on 24 April 1922, which was directly subordinated to the Pope.
In 1925 a concordat between Poland and the Holy See was signed and the Apostolic Administrator was now supposed to be subordinated to the Nuncio of Warsaw, which caused protests among the local populace.
Thus the Pope established the exempt Diocese of Danzig on 30 December 1925 and appointed Edward O'Rourke as the first Bishop on 2 January 1926.
The Diocese was promoted as Metropolitan Archdiocese of Gdańsk on 25 March 1992.
On 17 November 1993 the Archbishop issued the instructions on the status of Kashubian as a language of liturgy.

Román Basa (February 29, 1848 – February 6, 1897) was a Filipino patriot who was the second "Supremo" or leader of the Katipunan, the secret society which sparked the Philippine Revolution against Spanish rule in 1896.
Basa was born to Mariano Basa and Dorotea Esteban in San Roque, Cavite where he also completed his primary schooling.
It is not known where, or if, he completed his studies but he was employed in the "Comandancia de Marina" in Manila where he eventually rose to a position of responsibility.
While working in Manila, Basa lived in a boarding house where he met one of the founders of the Katipunan, Ladislao Diwa, who was then a law student at the University of Santo Tomas.
On November 9, 1892, he was initiated into the secret society under the name "Liwanag" (Brightness).
With the connivance of a crewman of a ship which made weekly trips between Manila and Hong Kong, he smuggled into the country copies of La Solidaridad and the novels of José Rizal which were banned by the Spanish colonial government.
In 1893, he was elected president of the secret society and introduced some changes in its operations, particularly the formation of a women's auxiliary section.
But he refused reelection the following year because of a difference with Katipunan founder Andrés Bonifacio.
Their difference stemmed from Basa's refusal to induct his son Lucio into the Katipunan and Bonifacio's handling of the society's funds.
After the Katipunan was uncovered in July 1896, Basa was arrested for sedition and treason in September 1896.
After being convicted by a Spanish military court, he was executed by musketry on February 6, 1897 along with Apolonio de la Cruz, Teodoro Plata, Vicente Molina, Hermenegildo de los Reyes, José Trinidad, Pedro Nicodemus, Feliciano del Rosario, Gervasio Samson and Doroteo Domínguez.
Roman Basa had a daughter nicknamed Tindeng aka Tindeng Torres (changed from Basa).
Most Basa changed their last name for fear of reprisal after the execution of Roman Basa.
She lived in San Roque, Cavite with her first cousin Gregorio Basa, who later became Presidente del Municipal now known as Cavite City.
After the death of Gregorio Basa, Tindeng lived a nomadic life, hopping from one relative's house to another.
This author knows because as a boy he called her "Lola Tindeng," while she was living in their house owned by the only daughter of Gregorio Basa.
As regards Lucio, this Basa family do not know if he existed his name was never mentioned in any Basa household.

Scorpa is a manufacturer of trials motorcycles based near Alès, France.
It was founded in 1993 by Marc Teissier and Joël Domergue.
The first model produced by the company was the WORKS 294 in 1994, powered by a single-cylinder, two-stroke Rotax engine.
In 1998, Scorpa signed an agreement with Yamaha Motor Company to use its engines in subsequent models.
The final range included trials bikes ranging from 125 cc to 249 cc, in both two- and four-stroke variants.
Scorpa also produced "long ride" models, that were mechanically similar to the SY trials range, but with a larger fuel tank, and a seat to allow longer trekking use.
Non-traditional models included the BMX-inspiried 4-Tricks and the trials/trail hybrid T-Ride.
On July 13, 2009, Scorpa announced on its website that it was going into bankruptcy liquidation.
In September 2009 it was announced that original owner Marc Tessier had purchased the company.
Operations have moved from Ales to Nîmes, France, and a full complement of Trials models will be produced for 2010.
These will include the TYS125 four-stroke, a 125 and 250 cc two-stroke SY, and a T-Ride model.
Scorpa has since been purchased by Sherco Motorcycles and continues to produce a range of 2 and 4 stroke trials motorcycles.

The Wendy's massacre was a mass murder that took place in a Wendy's fast-food restaurant at 4012 Main Street in Flushing, Queens, New York City, New York, on May 24, 2000.
Seven employees were shot in the head and five of them died.
The killings were carried out by 36-year-old John Taylor, a former employee of the restaurant, and his accomplice Craig Godineaux.
The robbery was carefully planned, as Taylor forced his former manager there, Jean Auguste, to summon the six employees to his office on the pretense of having an important meeting.
Taylor and Godineaux took the seven into the restaurant's freezer, bound and gagged them at gunpoint, put plastic bags over their heads, and then shot each of them in the head with a Bryco-Jennings Model J38 .380 caliber semi-automatic pistol.
All but two of them died.
One of the two survivors, Patricio Castro, dialed 9-1-1.
When police arrived, they found all the victims and discovered $2,400 missing from the safe.
The NYPD arrested Taylor and Godineaux less than 48 hours after the killings.
Evidence quickly mounted against the pair, including eyewitness testimony, ballistics, and fingerprints.
On January 22, 2001, Godineaux pleaded guilty and was later sentenced to life in prison.
Judge Steven W. Fisher instructed the jury that he would most likely sentence Taylor to a sentence of 175 years in prison if the jury did not return a unanimous verdict on the death penalty.
On November 19, 2002, Taylor was convicted on 20 counts of murder and attempted murder.
One week later, on November 26, the jury sentenced Taylor to death.
On October 23, 2007, the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, New York's highest court, vacated the death penalty portion of the verdict.
The Queens prosecutor's office fought unsuccessfully to have Taylor's case declared an exception to a 2004 Appeals Court's decision that found New York's death penalty law unconstitutional because of a flaw in its mandated instructions to the jury.
On November 29, 2007 Taylor was re-sentenced to life without parole for the five murders.
As of 2007, he had been the only inmate on Death Row in New York.
Taylor is currently serving his sentence at the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York, as inmate #03A0158, while Godineaux is currently serving his sentence at the Auburn Correctional Facility in Auburn, New York, as inmate #01A1186.
Killed in the massacre were: Seriously wounded:

"A Boy Named Sue" is a song written by humorist and poet Shel Silverstein and made popular by Johnny Cash.
Cash recorded the song live in concert on February 24, 1969 at California's San Quentin State Prison for his "At San Quentin" album.
Cash also performed the song (with comical variations on the original performance) in December 1969 at Madison Square Garden.
The live San Quentin version of the song became Cash's biggest hit on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart and his only top ten single there, spending three weeks at No. 2 in 1969, held out of the top spot by "Honky Tonk Women" by The Rolling Stones.
The track also topped the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts that same year and was certified Gold on August 14, 1969, by the RIAA.
Silverstein's own recording was released the same year as "Boy Named Sue", a single on the album "Boy Named Sue (and His Other Country Songs)", produced by Chet Atkins and Felton Jarvis.
The song tells the tale of a young man's quest for revenge on a father who abandoned him at three years of age and whose only contribution to his entire life was naming him Sue, commonly a feminine name, which results in the young man suffering from ridicule and harassment by everyone he meets in his travels.
Because of this, Sue grows up tough and mean, and smartens up very quickly, though he frequently relocates due to the shame his name gives him.
Angered by the embarrassment and abuse that he endures in his life, he swears that he will find and kill his father for giving him "that awful name".
Sue later locates his father at a tavern in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, during the middle of a summer season, and confronts him by saying, "My name is Sue!
How do you do?
Now you're gonna die!"
This results in a vicious brawl that spills outdoors into a muddy street.
After the two have beaten each other almost senseless, Sue's father admits that he is the "heartless hound" ("son of a bitch" in the Johnny Cash version) that named him Sue and explains that the name was given as an act of love.
Because Sue's father knew that he would not be there for his son, he gave him the name, believing (correctly) that the ensuing ridicule would force him to "get tough or die".
Learning this, Sue makes peace with his father and they reconcile.
With his lesson learned, Sue closes the song with a promise to name his son "Bill or George, anything but Sue".
The song has an unusual AABCCB rhyme scheme, broken only to mark the midpoint and ending.
The song is performed mostly in the speech-like style of talking blues rather than conventional singing.
The term "son of a bitch" in the line "I'm the son of a bitch that named you Sue!" was bleeped out in the Johnny Cash version both on the single and the "At San Quentin" album, and the final line was also edited to remove the word "damn".
Both the edited and unedited versions are available on various albums and compilations.
The term "son of a bitch" was edited to "son of a gun" or altogether bleeped out in some versions.
When performing the song live in later performances (such as in April 1970 at the White House and in 1994 at the Glastonbury Festival, for example), Cash would himself utter a bleep-censor sound in lieu of the word.
The unedited version of the original San Quentin performance is included on later reissues of the "At San Quentin" album and on Cash's posthumous "The Legend of Johnny Cash" album.
Silverstein, for his part, does not utter any profanity in his original version, with Sue's father instead identifying himself as the "heartless hound" that named him Sue.
The core story of the song was inspired by humorist Jean Shepherd, a close friend of Silverstein, who was often taunted as a child because of his feminine-sounding name.
The title might also have been inspired by the male attorney Sue K. Hicks of Madisonville, Tennessee, a friend of John Scopes who agreed to be a prosecutor in what was to become known as the "Scopes Monkey Trial".
Hicks was named after his mother who died after giving birth to him.
In his autobiography, Cash wrote that he had just received the song and only read over it a couple of times.
It was included in that concert to try it out—he did not know the words and on the filmed recording he can be seen regularly referring to a piece of paper.
Cash was surprised at how well the song went over with the audience.
The rough, spontaneous performance with sparse accompaniment was included in the "Johnny Cash At San Quentin" album, ultimately becoming one of Cash's biggest hits.
According to Cash biographer Robert Hilburn, neither the British TV crew filming the concert nor his band knew he planned to perform the song; he used a lyric sheet on stage while Perkins and the band improvised the backing on the spot.
While another song, "San Quentin", was expected to be the major new song featured in the concert and subsequent album (so much so the album includes two performances of "San Quentin"), "A Boy Named Sue" ended up being the concert's major find.
Cash also performed it on his own musical variety show, ending the song with the line, "And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him... John Carter Cash", referring to his newborn son.
Cash also performed this variant at the White House in April 1970; in later years, however, he would restore the original "any name but Sue" ending, but change the wording to "if I ever have another son".
When Cash performed with The Highwaymen in the 1980s and 1990s, he would end the song by saying "if I ever have another boy, I think I'm gonna name him Waylon, or Willie, or Kris." referring to fellow bandmates Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson According to Shel Silverstein's biographer Mitch Myers, it was June Carter Cash who encouraged her husband to perform the song.
Silverstein introduced it to them at what they called a "Guitar Pull," where musicians would pass a guitar around and play their songs.
Silverstein later wrote a follow-up named "The Father of a Boy Named Sue" on his 1978 "Songs and Stories" in which he tells the old man's point of view of the story.
The only known recording of the song by a major artist is by Shel Silverstein himself.
Various cover artists have covered this song since then.
MAD Magazine issue No. 137 (September 1970) included a parody titled "A Boy Dog Named Lassie", based on the fact that the "Lassie" movies and TV series employed male Collies in the female title role.
On an episode of "The Partridge Family", a part Native American character introduces himself as "Sioux" causing a reaction from the family members, "A boy name Sioux?"
The gender-bending implications of the title have been adapted to explore issues of sex and gender, another use of the popular song title that goes beyond its original scope.
The 2001 documentary "A Boy Named Sue" features a transgender protagonist and uses the song in the soundtrack. "A Boy Named Sue: Gender and Country Music" is the title of a 2004 book about the role of the gender in American country music.
In the film "Swingers", one of the male characters is named Sue.
The name is explained by another character by saying, "his dad was a big Johnny Cash fan." "A Boy Named Sue" is referenced in the Red Hot Chili Peppers songs "One Big Mob" and "Save This Lady."
In the "Dexter's Laboratory" episode '"A Boy Named Sue", Mandark recalls through his infancy and early childhood when his Hippie parents named him Susan and how he discovered his manhood by science.
The Stone Temple Pilots' song "Crackerman" references "A Boy Named Sue" in the second verse.
Wyrd Miniatures a hobby company, produces a male Outcast model named Sue for their Malifaux miniature skirmish game.
Chad Stokes Urmston references "A Boy Named Sue" in his 2014 song "Our Lives, Our Time".

Allesley is a suburban village and civil parish in the City of Coventry metropolitan borough, West Midlands, England, about 3 miles (5 km) west of Coventry city centre.
According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 805, which increased to 837 at the 2011 Census.
However, this does not include the neighbouring districts of Allesley Park and Allesley Green.
Until 1998 it was home to the main Jaguar car assembly plant at Browns Lane.
The parish of Allesley covers a much larger area than the village itself, which is based around Washbrook Lane, Browns Lane and Hawkesmill Lane.
The parish incorporates the ancient Ardens of Pinketts Booth, Pickford, Pickford Green, Harvest Hill, Hawkes End, Hollyberry End, Wall Hill, and Brownshill Green.
The suburbs of Allesley Park and Allesley Green lie to the south and west.
Allesley Park is a district developed between the 1950s and 1970s to the east of the A45 and due south of Allesley.
Allesley Green, built in the late-1980s, lies a quarter of a mile SW of Allesley.
The combined population of the three main districts is about 4000.
Allesley Village denotes the area east the Birmingham Road, including West Point.
Although this is largely a dormitory community for Coventry, it retains several aspects of a separate village.
Most of the old village is a conservation area on a low ridge of high ground between the River Sherbourne and the Pickford Brook, a tributary.
Allesley grew around the 800-year-old All Saints Church (known originally as All Souls Church up to the Reformation period).
Its spire is prominent on the skyline of the village.
Originally built around 1140, it was rebuilt in 1863 and remains relatively unaltered since then.
A noted writer on husbandry, Walter Blith, was baptised there on 7 August 1605.
The Birmingham Road, which runs through the village, was part of the turnpike trunk road built in 1821–24 by Thomas Telford between Holyhead and London.
A toll house originally stood at the junction of Holyhead Road and Allesley Old Road.
The tolls were discontinued by Act of Parliament in 1871, and the former toll house was demolished in the mid-1930s.
Allesley was home to the Browns Lane Jaguar car plant and its national showroom, which closed in the late 1990s.
Wood veneer production for Jaguar continued until the mid-2000s, after which the land was sold to developers.
Allesley is twinned with: The parish is home to the amateur rugby union club, Barkers Butts Rugby Football Club, who play at the Bob Coward Memorial Ground, just off Pickford Grange Lane.
Formed in 1946, they were originally based in Keresley until they moved to Allesley in 1975.

The World Amateur Chess Championship is a tournament organised by the World Chess Federation, FIDE.
FIDE intended to promote amateur chess play by holding championship tournaments linked to the Olympic Games, but only two events were held.
The first championship was held the year that FIDE was founded, at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris.
This is considered the unofficial first Chess Olympiad, and is the only Olympiad that was an individual event.
The second championship was held at the 1928 Summer Olympics in The Hague, in conjunction with the 2nd Chess Olympiad.
Chess has never been an official part of the Olympic Games, and since the chess community does not make any essential distinction between amateur and professional the championship was discontinued after 1928.
However, in 1995 FIDE has revamped it to celebrate the centenary of the Hastings International Chess Congress and since then has been held annually.
The first renewed edition, held concurrently with the 1995/96 Hastings Congress from 28 December 1995 to 5 January 1996, was rescricted to not FIDE-rated players.
Subsequently, amateur was defined as a player with a FIDE rating below 2000 and not having attained a rating of more than 2000 in the past 2 years.
In 2016, the event was split for the first time in three rating categories: U-2300, U-2000 and U-1700.
According to the current FIDE regulations, the winner is awarded with the title of FIDE Master (FM), while the runner-up and the bronze medallist receive the Candidate Master (CM) title.
Since 2012, there is another World Amateur Chess Championship, organised by the Amateur Chess Organisation (ACO), which is not recognised by FIDE.

Light a Penny Candle is a 1982 novel by the Irish author Maeve Binchy.
It was Binchy's first novel.
The plot follows two girls growing up during and in the aftermath of World War II.
London was a very dangerous place to live during World War II, and many children were evacuated to Ireland or the United States.
Only child Elizabeth White is sent to live with her mother's childhood friend and her large and bustling family, the O'Connors, in Ireland.
Although the mothers were childhood friends, their relationship has become one-sided with Elizabeth's mother, Violet, rarely corresponding and Aisling's mother, Eileen, remembering their closeness with detailed letters.
Violet believes even though Ireland is not as refined as her London, it is a safe place for her daughter.
Elizabeth quickly becomes fast friends with Ailing, who is the same age.
The story follows these two girls, along with the whole O'Connor family, as they grow into teenagers and young women.
Aisling is outgoing and bold, while Elizabeth is quiet with all the manners of a well-bred child.
Elizabeth is shown a caring, loving family and begins to feel part of a real family, as opposed to the cold environment of her parents' house.
After the war ends, Elizabeth goes back to London, leaving behind a loving family and returns to the quietness of her real family.
The two girls have formed a bond that remains, however, for years after the war is over.
They remain in close contact through letters, supporting each other through their marriages.
Their lives remain intertwined, each facing her own relationships, successes, and failures.

The nForce 700 is a chipset series designed by Nvidia first released in December 2007.
The series supports both Intel Core 2 and AMD Phenom processors, and replaces the nForce 600 series chipsets.
Several members were spotted, including the codenamed "MCP72" for AMD processors and the "C72" for Intel processors, launched with the name "nForce 780a" and "nForce 780i" chipsets respectively.
Currently, the released variants are the 750i, 780i, 790i, and 790i Ultra.
The memory controller is built-in into the CPU, the supported memory type depends on the CPU and socket used.
This way there are no supported memory types listed here.
The nForce 780i and 750i chipsets features the nForce 200 PCI-E bridge (previously codenamed "BR-04") connected to the northbridge via a 4.5 GT/s proprietary bus.
Its function is to implement the lack of PCI-E 2.0 support from the northbridge.
Helen Barrett Montgomery (July 31, 1861 – October 19, 1934) was an American social reformer, educator and writer.
In 1921 she was elected as the first woman president of the Northern Baptist Convention (and of any religious denomination in the United States).
She had long been a delegate to the Convention and a policymaker.
In 1893 she helped found a chapter of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union in Rochester, New York, and served as president until 1911, nearly two decades.
In 1899 Montgomery was the first woman elected to the Rochester School Board and any public office in the city, 20 years before women could vote.
Montgomery was an activist for women's and overseas missions and a successful fundraiser; in 1910-1911 she raised one million dollars by her national speaking tour (the funds raised were equivalent to $23.7 million in 2010), used chiefly to support colleges for women in China.
In 1921 as president of the Women's American Baptist Foreign Missionary Society, she gave their "Jubilee" contributions of more than $450,000 to the National Baptist Convention.
In 1924 she was the first woman to publish a translation of the "New Testament" from the original Greek.
Living mostly in Rochester, New York, she was influential in national and international progressive movements.
Since 1995, Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School has held an annual conference on Women in Church and Society, named in honor of Helen Barrett Montgomery.
In addition, the School is establishing an endowed fund in her name for its Program for the Study of Women and Gender in Church and Society.
Helen was the eldest of three children born to Amos Judson Barrett and Emily Barrows Barrett, both of whom were then teachers.
She was born in Kingsville, Ohio.
Her parents moved to Rochester, New York when she was a child so that her father could attend the Rochester Theological Seminary.
After he graduated in 1876, he was called as pastor of Lake Avenue Baptist Church in the city.
He served there until his death in 1889, when Helen was 28.
Helen Barrett studied at Wellesley College, where she graduated with teacher certification in 1884.
She had studied and excelled in Greek, leading her class. (Later she would write and publish a translation of the New Testament.)
She taught in Rochester and then at the Wellesley Preparatory School in Philadelphia.
On September 6, 1887, Barrett married a Rochester businessman, William A. Montgomery, owner of North East Electric Company. (This eventually became the Rochester Products Division of General Motors).
They adopted a daughter, whom they named Edith Montgomery.
Helen Barrett Montgomery's life work may be described under four headings: church, social reforms to benefit women, Bible translation, and missions.
She has been described by the scholar Kendal Mobley as a "domestic feminist": While she supported women's suffrage and believed women had rights as citizens to share political power, she emphasized the value to society of women's moral influence.
She did not question the validity of the idea of separate spheres for men and women.
Instead, she argued that the limits of woman's sphere were too narrow, and in her theory and practice she conceptualized a woman's sphere that was in fact limitless.
Like many other Progressives, she believed that the moral influence of True Womanhood and the values of the Victorian home ought to be extended throughout the state and the society.
Barrett Montgomery stayed on at Lake Avenue Baptist Church. (Her father died two years after her marriage.)
In 1892, the congregation licensed her to preach (not the same as ordination as a minister).
She organized and taught a women's Bible class at the church, which she led for 44 years in the midst of her other activities.
Her involvement and leadership in church circles and the city's women's movement led Montgomery to serve as a delegate to annual meetings of the Northern Baptist Convention, the association of Northern Baptist churches, where she helped decide policy.
The Convention was formed in 1907, bringing together most Baptists in the North who were associated with the historical missions to establish schools and colleges for freedmen in the South after the American Civil War.
Now the American Baptist Churches USA, the association of Northern Baptist churches was also active in missions to Asia, particularly China.
In 1921, Montgomery was the first woman to be elected president of the Northern Baptist Convention (NBC), and at the same time, became the first woman president of any religious denomination in the United States.
As president of the Women's American Baptist Foreign Mission Society, she had given their gift of more than $450,000 to the NBC.
She was elected after having demonstrated her successful fundraising.
During her year as president of the NBC, Montgomery spent considerable time in trying to prepare the churches for a new "statement of faith."
She worked to prevent the Convention from being taken over by fundamentalists and requiring an official confession.
Her correspondence during this period showed that she was motivated by her "defense of the cherished Baptist principle of liberty."
Speaking to the third Baptist World Congress in 1923, Montgomery said, "Jesus Christ is the great Emancipator of woman.
He alone among the founders of the great religions of the world looked upon men and women with level eyes, seeing not their differences, but their oneness, their humanity."
She strongly believed that women had an active role to play in the church and society.
Montgomery worked on social reforms in the United States, especially those to benefit women.
In 1893, she joined with Susan B. Anthony, the activist for civil rights who was nearly 40 years older, in forming a new chapter of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union (WEIU) in Rochester.
Montgomery served as president from 1893-1911, which "enabled her to exert broad influence in the city's social and political affairs."
She and Anthony worked together for more than a decade on women's issues in Rochester.
Following the example of chapters in Buffalo and Boston, the WEIU of Rochester served poor women and children in the city, which was attracting many Southern and Eastern European rural immigrants for its industrial jobs.
The WEIU also founded a legal aid office, set up public playgrounds, established a "Noon Rest" house where working girls could eat unmolested, and opened stations for mothers to obtain safe milk, which later developed as public health clinics.
It developed as one of the most important Progressive institutions in the city.
Montgomery also became known in the city for her advocacy of education.
Aided by the support of many women's groups, in 1899 she was the first woman elected to the Rochester School Board, as well as to any public office in Rochester, 20 years before women had the right to vote.
She was elected during a time when women had few public roles and rarely spoke in such venues.
She was re-elected and served a total of 10 years as a member of the Board.
During her tenure, Montgomery implemented several reforms to the public school system, such as introducing kindergarten and vocational training in public schools, and including health education in the curriculum.
In 1898, Montgomery and Susan B. Anthony responded to a challenge by the trustees of the University of Rochester, who had voted to make it coeducational if women's groups raised $100,000 to help with expenses.
They led 25 women's clubs in the city to raise money for a fund to support the admission of women students, reaching agreement with the trustees after collecting $50,000 by 1900. (The university was coed until 1909, then established a separate facility for women, which lasted until 1955.)
As Montgomery's interest in education for women was not limited to the US, she also raised funds for missionaries in Asia to start Christian colleges for women, particularly in China.
Her national speaking tour in 1910-1911 raised $1 million for this purpose. (See below under "Christian missions".)
Montgomery was the first woman to translate the New Testament into English from Greek and have it published by a professional publishing house. (Julia E. Smith published her translation privately, paying for it herself.)
Montgomery was inspired to write a new English translation because of her experience teaching street boys in her church, and finding they did not understand the dated language of the "King James Version" of the Bible.
When she used the Weymouth New Testament (1903), they understood it much better but she was still not satisfied.
She decided to write her own translation to "make it plain" for the "ordinary" reader.
It was published in 1924 as "The Centenary Translation", issued by the American Baptist Publication Society in celebration of its 100th anniversary.
This version has been reprinted as "The New Testament in Modern English", with a spine and cover labeled "Montgomery New Testament".
Hers is the only English translation by a Baptist woman that has been published.
Montgomery's translation was notable for her practice of inserting chapter and section titles (as seen in photo), a pioneering feature now commonly used in Bibles in many languages.
She included interpretations supporting enlarged roles for women in the church, which was influenced by her reading the works of Katharine C. Bushnell, a Methodist missionary. (Bushnell's work was rediscovered by theologians in 1975.)
Montgomery had reviewed an edition of Bushnell's collection "God's Word for Women" in 1924, but likely first came across the work when it was published in 1919.
Bushnell's influence is seen in Montgomery's translating 1 Cor.11:13-15 as statements rather than questions (as formerly interpreted by others), as illustrated below with comparisons between the "New American Standard Bible" and the "King James Version".
In addition, her notes to Rom 16:2 and to I Cor. 14:34 show her "familiarity" with Bushnell's argument.
Montgomery: "It is fitting that a woman should pray to God with her head unveiled."
NASB: "Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?"
KJV: "Is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?"
Montgomery supported missions by a variety of activities: her national speaking tour (1910–1911) raised $1 million for the mission fund (worth $23.7 million in 2010).
Much of the money was used to establish colleges for women in China.
She wrote books to publicize the missions.
Her book, "Western Women in Eastern Lands" (1910), studied the role of women missionaries and women's mission boards overseas.
This was a time of extensive Christian missionary activity in East Asia, especially China.
In 1913, at the request of the National Federation of Women's Boards of Foreign Missions, Montgomery traveled extensively in East Asia to study conditions of the ecumenical missions and women.
Her work, "The King's Highway" (1915), sold 160,000 copies.
She also served as president of the Women's American Baptist Foreign Mission Society (1914–1924).
In this capacity, in 1921 she provided a "Jubilee" gift to the Northern Baptist Convention of more than $450,000, which the women's Foreign Mission Society had raised.
Montgomery served as president of the National Federation (1917–1918).
She also helped found the World Wide Guild, an organization that encouraged young women to become involved in missions.
Not limiting her audience to adults, Montgomery worked as associate editor of "Everyland", a magazine for children that reported on international missions.
The following is a partial list of writings by Helen Barrett Montgomery:

"Deals with Our Devils" is the seventh episode of the fourth season of the American television series "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. ", based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D.
(Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his allies, who are trapped between dimensions.
It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise.
The episode was written by DJ Doyle, and directed by Jesse Bochco.
Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, and John Hannah. "Deals with Our Devils" originally aired on ABC on November 29, 2016, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 4.63 million viewers within a week of its release.
Coulson, Fitz and Robbie are trapped out of sync with reality, unable to interact with the real world, with no-one else able to see, hear or touch them.
They are being drawn to another dimension, which Robbie describes as Hell, revealing that the Ghost Rider spirit has been there before.
Killing several agents using his new powers, Morrow escapes, while the Ghost Rider spirit, unwilling to return to 'Hell', abandons Robbie and instead possesses Mack, just as he learns Morrow was allied with the Chinese Watchdogs, having recruited them to retrieve the ghost scientists and find the Darkhold.
Mack hunts down the remaining Chinese gang members, and Daisy pursues him, unknowingly accompanied by Robbie, who convinces the spirit to return to him and help him exact revenge on Morrow, in exchange for Robbie continuing to serve as the spirit's host afterwards. May decides to use the Darkhold to rescue Coulson, Fitz and Robbie, and enlists Radcliffe to read the Darkhold, but he finds the contents are too overwhelming for the human brain to perceive.
AIDA suggests she reads it instead, revealing her android nature to May (and Coulson), and with the magical knowledge she learns from the book, she builds a machine that opens a dimensional portal, through which Coulson, Fitz and Robbie return.
Meanwhile, Simmons frees Vijay from his Terrigen cocoon by touching it, at which point Nadeer immediately has her removed.
Upon returning to the Playground she reunites with Fitz, who learned of the deal Mace made with Nadeer while out of sync.
In an end tag, AIDA secretly begins experimenting with her new knowledge from the Darkhold, creating an artificial brain.
In November 2016, Marvel revealed that the seventh episode of the season would be titled "Deals with Our Devils", to be written by DJ Doyle, with Jesse Bochco directing.
Main cast members Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Ming-Na Wen as Melinda May, Chloe Bennet as Daisy Johnson / Quake, Iain De Caestecker as Leo Fitz, Elizabeth Henstridge as Jemma Simmons, Henry Simmons as Alphonso "Mack" MacKenzie, and John Hannah as Holden Radcliffe were confirmed to be starring in the episode.

O'Mara, Luna, Jansen, Wraith, Henrie, Osinski, Cavanaugh, Zuniga, and Miller reprise their roles from earlier in the series. "Deals with Our Devils" was first aired in the United States on ABC on November 29, 2016.
It began streaming on Netflix, along with the rest of the fourth season, on June 15, 2017.
In the United States the episode received a 0.8/3 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 0.8 percent of all households, and 3 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast.
It was watched by 2.41 million viewers.
Within a week of its release, "Deals with Our Devils" had been watched by 4.63 million U.S. viewers, above the season average of 4.22 million.
The episode was nominated for best Dialogue/ADR in Television – Short Form at the 64th Golden Reel Awards.
Boavista Futebol Clube Timor Leste or Boavista FC is a football club of East Timor based in Dili.
The team plays in the Liga Futebol Amadora.
The team was formerly known as Carsae Futebol Clube until 2017.
Originally the club formed in 1986 when Pedro Carrascalão was a high school student during the period when East Timor was still under Indonesian occupation.
But he closed it just after the incident at Santa Cruz, which refer to as the 12 November massacre.
Originally the name of the club was based on a cultural expression, Kumpulan Anak Remaja Lorosae, which in Indonesian means the "youth from where the sun rises".
But he had trouble when he used that name as some of players were active in the clandestine movement and were being chased by Indonesian intelligence forces, so he decided to simplify things and base the new name off an abbreviation of my surname.
His father was working as a governor at the time and it was the only way for him to protect his friends and keep the Indonesian military off.
It would be almost two-and-a-half decades before the chance arose for Carrascalao to revive the club and, despite some reservations with how football was being run in the country, he decided it was the right time to try to give young Timorese footballers a stage on which to display their talents.
He decided to open the club again in 2015 when there was a clear sign that there was going to be a national league in place for the very first time.
In less than four months the club was reassembled, staff was hired and players were recruited to participate in the top flight of the new government-funded Liga Futebol Amadora or LFA the first official league in the nation’s history.
The club's goal for the next three years is to become the biggest club in East Timor just as we were when the club was first founded from 1986 to 1991; then we started with football, then volleyball, then basketball for both men and women and we were pretty much number one year after year.
The maiden season of the LFA began in late February with eight teams scheduled to play each other in a home and away format, all matches held at the centralised Dili Municipal Stadium.
Carsae made a winning start by defeating D.I.T 1-0.
With another division below the top flight there will also be a cup competition, aptly named the 12th November Cup, and then a Super Taça which will pit both the league and cup champions against each other.
The hope is this can be a new dawn for the sport, which is easily the most popular throughout the nation.
George Miller (19 August 1929 – 1 January 2017) was a Scottish cricketer.

At the end of March, the race was confirmed to be held over 10–15 October.
The race was won by Diego Ulissi of Italy.

The culture of Vietnam originated from an ancient Baiyue Kingdom in East Asia called Nam Việt, which shared both "Bách Việt" and Han Culture with the ancient Bronze age Đông Sơn culture being widely considered one of its most important progenitors.
Han China invaded and annexed Nam Việt in 111 BC leading to the first Chinese domination of Vietnam.
Due to a millennium of Chinese rule, Vietnam was heavily and remarkably influenced by Chinese culture in terms of politics, government, Confucian social and moral ethics, and art.
Vietnam is considered to be part of the East Asian cultural sphere.
Following independence from China in the 10th century, Vietnam began a southward expansion that saw the annexation of territories formerly belonging to the Champa civilization (now Central Vietnam) and parts of the Khmer empire (modern southern Vietnam), which resulted in minor regional variances in Vietnam's culture due to exposure to these different groups.
During the French colonial period, Vietnamese culture absorbed various influences from the Europeans, including the spread of Catholicism and the adoption of the Latin alphabet.
Prior to this, Vietnamese had used both Chinese characters and a script called Chữ nôm which was based on Chinese but included newly invented characters meant to represent native Vietnamese words.
In the socialist era, the Vietnamese cultural life was deeply influenced by government-controlled media and the cultural influences of socialist programs.
For many decades, foreign cultural influences were shunned and emphasis placed on appreciating and sharing the culture of communist nations such as the Soviet Union, China, Cuba and others.
Since the 1990s, Vietnam has been exposed to other Asian, European and American culture and media.
Some elements generally considered to be characteristic of Vietnamese culture include ancestor veneration, ancestor worship, respect for community and family values, handicrafts and manual labour religious belief.
Important symbols present in Vietnamese culture include dragons, turtles, lotuses and bamboo.
In terms of societal levels of organization, the two most important units are "làng" (village) and "nước" (country).
The Vietnamese usually say that ""làng" goes hand in hand with "nước"."
Intermediate organizational units are "quận/huyện" (district), "xã" (commune) and "tỉnh" (province) "Main article: Military History of Vietnam"Vietnam has a long history of warfare, which played a big role in shaping the culture and Identity of the people who now live in the region known as Vietnam.
Major Events that shaped the nation to become the most militaristic nation in South East Asia are; Kinship plays an important role in Vietnam.
Unlike Western culture's emphasis on individualism, Eastern culture values in the roles of family and clanship.
Comparing with Eastern cultures, Chinese culture values family over clan while Vietnamese cultural values clan over family.
Each clan has a patriarch, clan altar, and death commemorations attended by the whole clan.
Most inhabitants are related by blood.
That fact is still seen in village names such as Đặng Xá (place for the Đặng clan), Châu Xá, Lê Xá, so on so forth.
In the Western highlands the tradition of many families in a clan residing in a longhouse is still popular.
In the majority of rural Vietnam today, one can still see three or four generations living under one roof.
The traditional Vietnamese wedding is one of the most important tradition in Vietnamese occasions.
Regardless of Westernization, many of the age-old customs practiced in a traditional Vietnamese wedding continue to be celebrated by both Vietnamese in Vietnam and overseas, often combining both Western and Eastern traditions.
In the past, both men and women were expected to be married at young ages.
Some mountainous places exists "Tao Hon" because one of the couples are too young to get married just 13 or 14 years old.
Marriages called contractual marriages were generally arranged by the parents and extended family, with the children having limited make decision on the matter.
In modern Vietnam, this has changed as people freely choose their own marriage partners called romantic marriage.
Generally there are two main ceremonies: When a person passes away in Vietnam, the surviving family holds a [Wake ceremony] or vigil that typically lasts about five to six days, but may last longer if the surviving family is waiting for other traveling relatives.
The body is washed and dressed.
A "le ngam ham", or chopstick, is laid between the teeth and a pinch of rice and three coins are placed in the mouth.
The body is put on a grass mat laid on the ground according to the saying, "being born from the earth, one must return back to the earth."
The dead body is enveloped with white cloth, "le kham niem", and placed in a coffin, "le nhap quan".
Finally, the funeral ceremony, "le thanh phuc", is officially performed.
The surviving family wear coarse gauze turbans and tunics for the funeral.
There are two types of funeral processions: In Vietnam, the family of the deceased undergo a ritual after 100 days of them passing away, where the whole family sits in pairs in a long line up to a single member of the family.
A monk (Thay Cung) will place a thin piece of cotton over the family member's head and ring a bell and chant while rotating the bell around the deceased's head, sending them in to a trance and open a way for the deceased to return to the living.
A bamboo tree with only leaves on the top with small pieces of paper with the deceased's name written on them will start to wave when the deceased is coming.
Normally this ritual will take all day to prepare and then as long as 6 hours praying and chanting, changing the family member at the front of the line.
Afterwards they will then burn a paper house and paper made possessions (that which the deceased would have loved during his/her life) so that they may take it through to their next life with them.
Religion in Vietnam has historically been largely defined by a mix of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism, known in Vietnamese as the Tam Giáo ("triple religion").
Catholicism is also practiced in modern Vietnam.
Ancestor worship is common in Vietnamese culture.
Most Vietnamese, regardless of religious denomination, practice ancestor worship and have an ancestor altar at their home or business, a testament to the emphasis Vietnamese culture places on filial piety.
Vietnamese literature includes two major components: folk literature and written literature.
The two forms developed simultaneously and are profoundly interrelated.
Vietnamese folk literature came into being very early and had a profound effect on the spiritual life of the Viet.
The folk literature contributed to the formation of Vietnam's national identity with praising beauty, humanism, and the love of goodness.
Legends, fairy tales, humorous stories, folk songs, epic poems have a tremendous vitality and have lived on until today.
Written literature was born roughly in the 10th century.
Up until the 21st century, there had been two components existing at the same time: works written in the Han characters (with poems and prose demonstrating the Vietnamese soul and realities; thus, they were still regarded as Vietnamese literature) and works written in the Nom character (mostly poems; many great works were handed down to the later generations).
Since the 1920s, written literature has been mainly composed in the National language with profound renovations in form and category such as novels, new-style poems, short stories and dramas, and with diversity in artistic tendency.
Written literature attained speedy development after the August Revolution, when it was directed by the Vietnamese Communist Party's guideline and focused on the people's fighting and work life.
Modern Vietnamese literature has developed from romanticism to realism, from heroism in wartime to all aspects of life, and soared into ordinary life to discover the genuine values of the Vietnamese.
Classical literature generated such masterpieces as "Truyen Kieu" (Nguyễn Du), "Cung Oán Ngâm Khúc" (Nguyễn Gia Thiều), "Chinh Phu Ngam" (Dang Tran Con), and "Quoc Am Thi Tap" (Nguyễn Trãi).
Some brilliant female poets are Hồ Xuân Hương, Doan Thi Diem, and Bà Huyện Thanh Quan.
Traditional Vietnamese art is a part of art practiced in Vietnam or by Vietnamese artists, from ancient times (including the elaborate Đông Sơn drums) to post-Chinese domination art which was strongly influenced by Chinese Buddhist art, as well as Taoism and Confucianism.
The art of Champa and France also played a smaller role later on.
The Chinese The chinese arts influence on Vietnamese art extends into Vietnamese pottery and ceramics, calligraphy, and traditional architecture.
Currently, Vietnamese lacquer paintings have proven to be quite popular.
Calligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using Chinese characters along with Chữ Nôm.
However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based Quốc Ngữ, which has proven to be very popular.
In the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life.
On special occasions such as the Lunar New Year, people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words).
People who could not read or write also often commissioned at temple shrines.
Vietnamese silk painting is one of the most popular forms of art in Vietnam, favored for the mystical atmosphere that can be achieved with the medium.
During the 19th and 20th centuries, French influence was absorbed into Vietnamese art and the liberal and modern use of color especially began to differentiate Vietnamese silk paintings from their Chinese, Japanese and Korean counterparts.
Vietnamese silk paintings typically showcase the countryside, landscapes, pagodas, historical events or scenes of daily life.
A folk art with a long history in Vietnam, Vietnamese woodblock prints have reached a level of popularity outside of Vietnam.
Organic materials are used to make the paint, which is applied to wood and pressed on paper.
The process is repeated with different colors.
Vietnamese music varies slightly in the three regions: or North, or Central, and or South.
Northern classical music is Vietnam's oldest and is traditionally more formal.
Vietnamese classical music can be traced to the Mongol invasions, when the Vietnamese captured a Chinese opera troupe.
Central classical music shows the influences of Champa culture with its melancholic melodies.
Southern music exudes a lively laissez-faire attitude.
Vietnam has some 50 national music instruments, in which the set of percussion instruments is the most popular, diverse and long-lasting such as "đàn đáy, đàn tranh, đàn nhị, đàn bầu" ...
The set of blowing instruments is represented by flutes and pan-pipes, while the set of string instruments is specified by "dan bau" and "dan day".
The Vietnamese folksongs are rich in forms and melodies of regions across the country, ranging from "ngâm thơ" (reciting poems), "hát ru" (lullaby), "hò" (chanty) to "hát quan họ, trong quan, xoan, dum, ví giặm, ca Huế, bài chòi, ly".
Apart from this, there are also other forms like "hát xẩm, chầu văn", and "ca trù."
Two of the most widely known genres are: In the 20th century, in contact with the Western culture, especially after the national independence, many new categories of arts like plays, photography, cinemas, and modern art had taken shape and developed strongly, obtaining huge achievements with the contents reflecting the social and revolutionary realities.
Up to 1997, there have been 44 people operating in cultural and artistic fields honored with the Ho Chi Minh Award, 130 others conferred with People's Artist Honor, and 1011 people awarded with the Excellent Artist Honor.
At the start of 1997, there were 191 professional artistic organizations and 26 film studios (including central and local ones).
There have been 28 movies, 49 scientific and documentary films receiving international motion picture awards in many countries. :) Water puppetry , is a distinct Vietnamese art form which had its origins in the 10th century and very popular in northern region.
In Water puppetry a split-bamboo screen obscures puppets which stand in water, and are manipulated using long poles hidden beneath the water.
Epic story lines are played out with many different puppets, often using traditional scenes of Vietnamese life.
The puppets are made from quality wood, such as the South East Asian Jackfruit tree.
Each puppet is carefully carved, and then painted with numerous successive layers of paint in order to protect the puppets.
Despite nearly dying out in the 20th century, water puppetry has been recognized by the Vietnamese government as an important part of Vietnam's cultural heritage.
Today, puppetry is commonly performed by professional puppeteers, who typically are taught by their elders in rural areas of Vietnam.
Vietnam has 54 different ethnicities, each with their own traditional dance.
Among the ethnic Vietnamese majority, there are several traditional dances performed widely at festivals and other special occasions, such as the lion dance.
In the imperial court, there also developed throughout the centuries a series of complex court dances which require great skill.
Some of the more widely known are the imperial lantern dance, fan dance, and platter dance, among others.
Communication in Vietnam, like other countries in the region, is indirect, based upon rapport and respect, and relies heavily on body language.
Showing agreement by saying "yes" shows respect even if the person does not agree with what's being said.
For example, one would say "yes" to an invitation even if one does not intend on attending.
The individual would simply not attend.
Breaking this rapport or disagreeing is deemed disrespectful.
Face facial expression is crucial to Vietnamese, so they are usually very indirect with what they say and usually avoid stating their opinion in case they are wrong.
It is considered to be polite if women speak softly when they talk.
If they talk with a high volume in their speech, it is considered to be negative.
Children are unable to disagree with elders.
Smiling is often used as an apology.
Eye contact is usually avoided.
Taboo things in western culture, such as asking about one's age or salary during an initial meeting, is normal.
Storytelling is often used as a form of communication.
Vietnamese cuisine is extremely diverse, often divided into three main categories, each pertaining to Vietnam's three main regions (north, central and south).
It uses very little oil and many vegetables, and is mainly based on rice, soy sauce, and fish sauce.
Its characteristic flavors are sweet (sugar), spicy (serrano pepper), sour (lime), "nuoc mam" (fish sauce), and flavored by a variety of mint and basil.
Vietnam also has a large variety of noodles and noodle soups.
Different regions invented typically different types of noodles, varying in shapes, tastes, colors, etc.
One of the nation's most famous type of noodles is phở (pronounced "fuh"), a type of noodle soup originating in North Vietnam, which consists of rice noodles and beef soup (sometimes chicken soup) with several other ingredients such as bean sprouts and scallions (spring onions).
It is often eaten for breakfast, but also makes a satisfying lunch or light dinner.
The boiling stock, fragrant with spices and sauces, is poured over the noodles and vegetables, poaching the paper-thin slices of raw beef just before serving.
Phở is meant to be savored, incorporating several different flavors: the sweet flavour of beef, sour lemons, salty fish sauce, and fresh vegetables.
Currently, Vietnamese cuisine has been gaining popularity and can be found widely in many other countries such as Singapore, the United States, Australia, Canada, South Korea, Laos, Japan, China, Malaysia, and France.
Vietnamese cuisine is recognized for its strict, sometimes choosy selection of ingredients.
A chef preparing authentic Vietnamese cuisine may incorporate the ingredients provided in these countries, but generally will prefer ingredients native to Vietnam.
In feudal Vietnam, clothing was one of the most important marks of social status and strict dress codes were enforced.
Prior to the Nguyễn dynasty, people not of noble birth could dress quite liberally with only few restrictions on styles.
For example, wearing yellow color in the Lý dynasty was tolerable since the Imperial clan wore red and white color.
However, things changed at the beginning of the Nguyễn dynasty.
Commoners now had a limited choice of similarly plain and simple clothes for every day use, as well as being limited in the colors they were allowed to use.
For instance, commoners were not allowed to wear clothes with dyes other than black, brown or white (with the exception of special occasions such as festivals), but in actuality these rules could change often based upon the whims of the current ruler.
The Áo giao lĩnh (襖交領) was a traditional cross-collared robe worn by Vietnamese before the 19th century.
During the Nguyen dynasty, it was replaced by the áo dài and became obsolete.
The Áo Tứ Thân or "four-part dress" is one such example of an ancient dress widely worn by commoner women, along with the Áo yếm bodice which accompanied it.
Peasants across the country also gradually came to wear silk pajama-like costumes, known as "Áo cánh" in the north and Áo bà ba in the south.
The headgear differed from time to time.
People of the Lý dynasty and Nguyễn dynasty often put on a plain piece of cloth wrapped around the head (generally called Khăn đóng), while in Trần dynasty and Lê dynasty leaving the head bare was more common.
Beside the popular Nón Lá (conical hat), a vast array of other hats and caps were available, constructed from numerous different types of materials, ranging from silk to bamboo and horse hair.
Even the Nón Lá (conical hat) used to take several different shapes and sizes, now only two styles still persist.
For footwear peasants would often go barefoot, whereas sandals and shoes were reserved for the aristocracy and royalty.
Nguyễn Monarchs had the exclusive right to wear the color gold, while nobles wore red or purple.
In the past the situation was different, Đinh dynasty and Lý dynasty rulers wore red, and Trần dynasty emperors wore white.
Each member of the royal court had an assortment of different formal gowns they would wear at a particular ceremony, or for a particular occasion.
The rules governing the fashion of the royal court could change dynasty by dynasty, thus Costumes of the Vietnamese court were quite diverse.
However, certain fundamental concepts applied.
The most popular and widely recognized Vietnamese national costume is the . Áo Dài was once worn by both genders but today it is worn mainly by women, except for certain important traditional culture-related occasions where some men do wear it.
Áo Dài consists of a long gown with a slit on both sides, worn over cotton or silk trousers.
Adoption and enforcement of Aó Dài took place in the mid 18th century by the rulers of Huế.
They decided that their garments had to be distinctive to set themselves apart from the people of Tonkin where "áo giao lĩnh" and "nhu quần" were worn.
White Áo dài is the required uniform for girls in many high schools across Vietnam.
In some types of offices (e.g. receptionists, secretaries, tour guides), women are also required to wear Áo Dài.
In daily life, the traditional Vietnamese styles are now replaced by Western styles.
Traditional clothing is worn instead on special occasions, with the exception of the white Áo Dài commonly seen with high school girls in Vietnam.
Vietnamese martial arts are highly developed from the country's long history of warfare and attempts to defend itself from foreign occupation.
Although most heavily influenced by Chinese martial arts, it has developed its own characteristics throughout the millennia in combination with other influences from its neighbours.
Vietnamese martial arts is deeply spiritual due to the influence of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism, and is strongly reliant on the "Viet Vo Dao" (philosophy of Vietnamese martial arts).
It is probably most famous for its scissor kicks.
The general Vietnamese term for martial arts is "Võ-Thuật."
Some of the more popular include: Vietnamese martial arts remains relatively unknown in the world today when compared to its counterparts from China, Japan, Korea or Thailand.
However, this is seeing a definite change as schools teaching various styles of Vietnamese martial arts are starting to pop up all over the world, notably in countries such as Spain.
Vietnam celebrates many holidays, including traditional holidays which have been celebrated in Vietnam for thousands of years, along with modern holidays imported predominantly from western countries.
Among the traditional holidays, the two most important and widely celebrated are the Lunar new year (Tết), followed by the Mid-autumn lantern festival (Tết Trung Thu), although the latter has been losing ground in recent years.
Vietnam has a number of UNESCO-listed World Heritage Sites, as well as cultural relics deemed as intangible heritage.
These are split into specific categories: There are a number of other potential world heritage sites, as well as intangible cultural heritage which Vietnam has completed documents on for UNESCO's recognition in the future.

The Evens-McMullan House (also known as Magnolia Manor) is a historic residence in Greenville, Alabama.
It was built in the late 1860s by Holden Evens, a lumberman who specially selected the timber used in its construction.
It was purchased in 1891 by Frank McMullen, a Greenville jeweler.
The house is a two stories, and follows the basic I-house form, but with a front-facing gable and a pair of one-story wings off the rear.
The front porch has Victorian latticed supports and spandrels.
The interior features a curved staircase in the entry hall.
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.
The Goldfield, Nevada labor troubles of 1906-1907 were a series of strikes and a lockout which pitted gold miners and other laborers, represented by the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), against mine owners and businessmen.
The troubles are significant because in Goldfield the IWW gained its greatest degree of power in a labor market, and came closest to its ideal of "the one big union."
The power of the IWW was ended by the controversial occupation by federal troops in December 1907.
Goldfield was organized as a town in October 1903 near recently discovered gold deposits in a remote spot of the southern Nevada desert.
The population of the town rose to 15,000 to 18,000 during the boom of 1904-1905, with another 2,000 in the suburbs.
This briefly made Goldfield the most populous town in Nevada.
Numerous new mining companies were established to mine at Goldfield, and shares found a ready market of investors.
Demand for labor outstripped supply, giving labor unions the advantage.
Soon after mining on an extensive scale began at Goldfield, the miners organized themselves as a local branch of the Western Federation of Miners.
The Industrial Workers of the World was founded in 1905 in Chicago.
Soon after, the Western Federation of Miners affiliated with the IWW, as its mining department.
The description of the IWW as "one big union" summarized their negotiating tactics: a wrong done to any worker was seen as the concern of all workers, and was likely to be met with a general strike.
The IWW also espoused radical socialism, and eschewed political action in favor of "direct action," with the goal of eliminating private ownership of businesses.
One of the forms of direct action favored by the IWW was sabotage, which the union, officially at least, defined as working inefficiently or stupidly, so as to reduce profits of business owners, and thus hasten the end of capitalism.
American Federation of Labor president Samuel Gompers observed that, as used by the IWW, "In actual practice it is hard to distinguish direct action, sabotage, and violence."
After the affiliation of the WFM with the IWW in 1905, the IWW organized nearly all the other workers in town, including bartenders, newsboys, and faro dealers.
The numerous mining companies were under pressure from shareholders to show gold production without delay, which gave the unions further advantage.
At the height of its power in Goldfield, he IWW did not even negotiate, but simply posted wage rates and required that employers comply.
Local IWW leader Vincent St. John fondly recalled: The mine owners were upset with the radicalism of the IWW, as well as with the high wages, and suggested that the WFM chapter (the mine workers) merge with the IWW chapter (the town workers), expecting that the more conservative miners would dampen the radicalism of the IWW.
However, exactly the opposite happened, and the IWW radicals came to dominate the mine workers.
The union declared strikes in December 1906 and January 1907 for higher wages.
The mine owners capitulated both times.
IWW influence was at its peak on January 20, 1907, when all mines, restaurants,and saloons in Goldfield shut down on orders from the IWW, to increase attendance at the union's parade commemorating slain Russian revolutionaries, and to support Big Bill Haywood and two other WFM leasers, then under arrest in Idaho for conspiracy to murder ex-governor Steunenberg.
That night, veteran WFM organizer Vincent St. John spoke to a packed audience in the union hall, promised revolution, and proclaimed: "We have no enemy but the capitalist class!"
Mine owner George Wingfield's spies in the IWW reported that Vincent St. John saw Nevada as an isolated state with a small population where he could achieve his dream of a syndicalist-socialist utopia.
Starting with Goldfield as a nucleus, he thought that the IWW could organize the whole state, then shut down the state in a general strike, after which the IWW would simply step in and run things, in place of state and local governments.
A Chicago "Record-Herald" reporter wrote from Goldfield: "Socialism never had such a taste of the sweets of autocracy as it had in this southern Nevada mining camp, and it grew drunk with its power."
Nationally, many WFM members were wary of the radicalism of the IWW, and did not want to give financial control to the IWW.
The WFM delegates walked out of the 1906 IWW convention when the more radical faction - those opposed to political action - won control of the IWW.
In 1907 the WFM, which made up about a third of the IWW membership, voted in a referendum to withdraw from the IWW.
But for some time after the breakup, the WFM and IWW in Goldfield continued to work closely together.
The leader of the WFM chapter in Goldfield was Vincent St. John, who shared the revolutionary ideals of the IWW.
Some workers unwilling to join the IWW/WFM were forcibly ejected from the town by IWW members, sometimes accompanied by beatings.
In their quest for the "one big union," with revolutionary ideals, the IWW did not compromise with or accommodate other unions, and often fought rival unions as hard as they fought capitalism.
Critics called this policy "rule or ruin."
By 1907, the only two unions in Goldfield holding out against joining the IWW/WFM were two AFL-affiliated locals: the Carpenters Union, and the Typesetters' union at the Goldfield "Sun".
The IWW demanded that typesetters for the Goldfield "Sun" join the IWW.
When they refused to do so, the IWW demanded that Lindley Branson, the owner and editor of the "Sun", who also owned the Tonopah "Sun", fire all non-IWW workers.
But the "Sun" typesetters had been in the AFL Typesetters' Union for years, and the "Sun" had long recognized their union, and paid them union wages.
The typesetters saw no reason to switch unions, and the Sun owner refused to fire them, and criticized the IWW in strong terms in his newspapers.
In retaliation, the IWW, which was famous for its free speech fights, tried to shut down the "Sun" by orchestrating boycotts.
The IWW ordered the town newsboys, all members of the IWW, to refuse to carry the "Sun".
The IWW pressured businesses to stop advertising in the "Sun", threatening boycotts against any businesses that did not fall in line.
Individual IWW members could be fined $15 for buying the "Sun".
The IWW set down conditions for ending its boycotts of the "Sun".
Conditions included a published apology to the IWW, and a publication of a weekly column written by the IWW.
Rather than surrender his editorial independence to the IWW, Branson sold the Goldfield "Sun" in August 1907, and moved 27 miles north to Tonopah, where his Tonopah "Sun" continued to criticize the IWW.
As part of their campaign against the AFL Carpenters' Union, the IWW threatened restaurants with union boycotts if they served meals to non-IWW carpenters.
Most fell in line, but restaurateur Anton Silva continued to serve the AFL Carpenters, so the IWW declared a boycott against Silva, and began picketing his restaurant; business dropped drastically.
When Silva confronted two pickets, W. R. Preston and Joseph Smith, in a threatening manner, Preston shot and killed Silva.
Preston, a business agent of the IWW, pleaded self-defense, but a jury convicted him.
The jury also convicted Smith, an officer of the union, for being an accomplice.
The two received sentences of 25 years and 10 years.
The case became a rallying-point for both sides.
The IWW insisted that Preston shot in self-defense, and that Smith was just a bystander, but that they were falsely convicted because of their union activism.
The mine owners said that it was a premeditated plot to murder Silva, as an example to others.
In March 1907, the IWW ordered the AFL Carpenters to either join the IWW or leave town.
The Carpenters did neither, but instead started carrying firearms to work.
The IWW ordered the mine owners to stop employing members of the AFL Carpenters union.
Instead, the mine owners banded together, and declared that they would hire no IWW members.
To achieve this, the mine owners declared a lockout.
But once more, the mine owners gave in, and on 1 April 1907, signed an agreement to last two years, under which only members of the Goldfield Miners' Union (the local branch of the WFM) were allowed to work in and around the mines, excepting only managers and superintendents.
The WFM and IWW had achieved their goals of bringing nearly all workers in Goldfield into the two unions.
Beginning in August 1907, a rule was introduced at some of the mines requiring miners to change their clothing before entering and after leaving the mines — a rule made necessary, according to the operators, by the wholesale stealing (in miners' parlance, "high-grading") of the very valuable ore (some of it valued at as high as $20 a pound).
Miners had traditionally been paid in cash.
In November 1907, following upon a nationwide financial panic, some of the owners adopted a system of paying wages half in gold, and half in cashier's checks drawn on the John T. Cook Bank in Goldfield.
The miners insisted on being paid in legal tender or guaranteed checks.
After several weeks of futile negotiations, the Goldfield Miners Union went out on strike on 27 November 1907.
The mine owners did not want a repeat of their unsuccessful lockout of the previous March.
The mine owners convinced Governor John Sparks that troops were needed to prevent violence.
But the governor could not send in the state militia, because there was no state militia.
Governor Sparks asked President Theodore Roosevelt to send federal troops into Goldfield, writing that violence at Goldfield included "unlawful dynamiting of property, commission of felonies, threats against the lives of law-abiding citizens, ..." But Roosevelt hesitated.
Federal troops were by law a last resort, and there did not seem to be widespread disorder in the town.
Also, he saw no political advantage in being embroiled in a labor dispute.
Roosevelt was skeptical, but after several Nevada officials assured him that uncontrolled violence existed in Goldfield, Roosevelt sent Brigadier General Frederick Funston, commander of the Division of California, at San Francisco, to investigate.
Funston told Roosevelt that although violence was not prevalent at the time, that at least 300 of the 1,000 striking miners were radicals prone to violence.
Funston recommended that Army troops be sent to Goldfield to maintain order.
Roosevelt followed Funston's advice, and US Army troops arrived from San Francisco on 7 December 1907.
The mine owners immediately requested that the troops be assigned to guard the mines, but Colonel Reynolds, the commander of the Army troops, refused.
He had been directed by his superiors to take orders only from Washington, not those of state or local officials, or mine owners.
Reynolds been sent to put down an insurrection, and had arrived to find a peaceful situation.
As far as he was concerned, he and his men had no reason to be there, although this was not the opinion of his superior, General Funston.
Mindful of the controversial actions of federal troops in the mining labor disputes at Coeur d'Alene, Idaho in 1892 and 1899, Roosevelt repeatedly urged the Army to act with restraint.
The president admonished Funston by telegram: The day after troops arrived, the mine owners reduced wages, and announced that the mines would reopen 12 December, with imported nonunion labor if needed.
Conditions remained peaceful, but once the mines brought in nonunion men, violence became highly probable if the troops were to be withdrawn.
Colonel Reynolds saw that the mine owners had planned the pay cut, but had needed the presence of his troops to impose it without suffering violence and disorder.
Torn between the report of Col. Reynolds that Goldfield was peaceful, and messages from General Funston and state officials that the situation was too dangerous to withdraw troops, Roosevelt appointed a special commission to investigate and report back.
Roosevelt's commission noted the radical views of the miners' union leadership, and advised Roosevelt that following the pay cuts announced by the mine owners, withdrawal of troops would result in violence.
Roosevelt concluded that although conditions had not warranted Sparks's appeal for assistance, that the immediate withdrawal of the troops might lead to serious disorder.
So he consented that troops should remain for a short time, but on condition that the state should immediately organize an adequate militia or police force.
Accordingly, a special meeting of the legislature was immediately called, a state police force was organized, and on March 7, 1908, the last troops were withdrawn.
Thereafter, work was gradually resumed in the mines, the contest having been won by the mine owners.
The labor struggle coincided with a national economic downturn, and consequent loss of investment, and jobs, in Nevada mining companies.
It also took place while the national WFM was withdrawing from affiliation with the IWW.
The split between the two nationally made it more difficult to present a united front against the mine owners.
Former WFM official Vincent St. John, who went with the IWW, complained that the "fight was compromised by the treachery of the W.F.M. general officers."
The intense mining activity at Goldfield was sustained in part by promotional stock investments.
When Goldfield mining shares lost favor with investors, the bubble burst.
By 1908, the population had shrunk to 5,400, and by 1910, it was only 1,600.

South Arabia is a historical region that consists of the southern region of the Arabian Peninsula, mainly centered in what is now the Republic of Yemen, yet it has also historically included Najran, Jizan, and 'Asir, which are presently in Saudi Arabia, and the Dhofar of present-day Oman.
South Arabia is inhabited by people possessing distinctive linguistic and ethnic affinities, as well as traditions and culture, transcending recent political boundaries.
It is roughly the same as Greater Yemen.
The frontiers of South Arabia as linguistically conceived would include the historic peoples speaking the related South Arabian languages as well as neighboring dialects of Arabic, and their descendants.
Anciently, there was a South Arabian language, which was borrowed by Ethiopia.
Yemen or "al-Yaman" means "the right side".
One etymology derives Yemen from "yamin" the "right side" as the south is on the right when facing the sunrise; yet this etymology is considered suspect.
In colloquial Islamic understanding, "al-yemeen", "the right side" refers to its position on the right of the Arabian Peninsula when one is located in Mecca and Medina, of Saudi Arabia, the holy cities.
Another derives Yemen from "yumn" meaning "felicity" as the region is fertile; indeed the Romans called it Arabia Felix.
Yaman derives from Yam, Yams, Yame, Yame or Miya, Miyah, Miah (water).
Three thousand years ago, several ancient states occupied the region of South Arabia, being M'ain, Qataban, Hadhramaut, and Saba.
In these ancient times South Arabia claimed several notable features: the famous dam at Marib, the cosmopolitan incense trade, as well as the legendary Queen of Sheba.
Two thousand years ago the Himyarites became the masters of South Arabia, dominating the region for several centuries.
The Ethiopian Kingdom of Aksum invaded South Arabia first in the 3rd–4th centuries, then later in the 6th under King Kaleb who subjugated the region, c. 520.
They were displaced by Persian forces of the Sassanid dynasty, c.575, who also arrived by sea.
A half-century later, in the year 6 A.H. (628), the region converted to Islam.

Monte Soratte (ancient: "Soracte") is a mountain ridge in the province of Rome, Italy.
It is a narrow, isolated limestone ridge with a length of and six peaks.
Located some south east of Civita Castellana and c. north of Rome, it is the sole notable ridge in the Tiber Valley.
The nearest settlement is the village of Sant'Oreste.
Saint Orestes or Edistus, after whom the settlement is named, is said to have been martyred near Monte Soratte.
The highest summit is above sea-level.
The ridge is part of a Natural Reserve housing a variety of vegetation and fauna.
It is also characterized by the so-called "Meri", pits which can be up to deep.
The area was used by the ancient Italic peoples of the area (Sabines, Capenates, Falisci) and the Etruscan civilization for the cult of the God Soranus.
Mount Soratte was mentioned by Horace ("vides ut alta stet nive candidum Soracte?" "Carm."
i. 9), and Virgil, who stated that Apollo was its guardian deity.
The hermitage of St. Sylvester is just below the summit.
According to a legend, its church was founded by Pope Sylvester, who had taken refuge there to escape Constantine's persecution.
The church houses 14th- and 15th-century frescoes.
Another four hermitages are on the ridge.
The church of "Santa Maria delle Grazie" was built in 1835 over a pre-existing 16th-century edifice and houses a once highly venerated image of the "Madonna".
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe mentioned the peak in "Italian Journey", his diary of his travels through Italy from 1786–1788.
He wrote that "Soracte stands out by itself in magnificent solitude.
Probably this mountain is made of limestone and belongs to the Apennines."
During World War II, after the 8 September 1943 Frascati air raid, Field Marshal Albert Kesselring moved his headquarters from Frascati to the bunkers in Monte Soratte.
Mount Olive Cathedral is a Christian Methodist Episcopal cathedral in Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America.
It is located on the corners of Linden Avenue and Lauderdale Street.
The Reverend Dr. Stevey M. Wilburn is the current minister of the cathedral.
Mt.
Olive Cathedral originally started as a church in the Jug Factory on the corner of South Orleans and Georgia Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee.
As the congregation grew, the church moved into a building they had rented, and from there a brick church was built on Georgia Avenue. in 1952, the church moved to its current place, and became a cathedral.
The land provided for the cathedral to be built was bought by the church from the white congregation of First Baptist Church.
The cooperation of the segregated churches made an article on the New York Times.

"Try" is the thirty-fourth episode of the American television drama series "The Killing", which aired on July 14, 2013.
The episode is written by Nic Sheff and Aaron Slavick; directed by Lodge Kerrigan.
In the episode, Pastor Mike (Ben Cotton) kidnaps Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos).
Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman) and the police must listen to the Linden/Pastor conversation via her two-way radio, which she has activated unbeknownst to Pastor Mike.
Ray Seward (Peter Sarsgaard) panics as his execution is two days away.
Bullet (Bex Taylor-Klaus) roams the streets looking for Lyric (Julia Sarah Stone) and learns about Angie Gower (Laine MacNeil).
In Linden's car, Pastor Mike, holding a knife to her throat, takes her phone and gun then orders her to drive around.
She secretly turns on her police radio and tries to talk him down.
At the police station, Bullet tells Holder that Lyric called and that Mike is taking Lyric to the woods where he killed the other girls.
Holder relays the news to Skinner (Elias Koteas), who's reluctant to take action.
When Holder vouches for his informant, Skinner pulls half the officers searching trains for Mike and redirects them to the woods around the pond.
Holder hears Linden's voice over an open radio channel and realizes she's being held hostage.
Skinner redirects all resources to find Linden's car.
All officers in the room listen intently as Linden talks to Pastor Mike.
Linden tells Mike that she understands his work because she grew up in foster care.
He accuses her of trying to humanize herself so that he won't kill her, adding that it won't work.
He then opens up about the kidnapping incident in Tempe, Arizona, saying he was wrongly accused and was just trying to help the girl through drug detoxification.
Instead, he lost his ministry.
He says no one believed him, that they all looked at him as Linden was looking at him at that moment.
He directs her to a desolate parking garage, where the radio cuts out.
He sits in silence, gun at the ready, and she urges him to tell the police about the girl in Tempe.
She then confides about her strained relationship with son Jack.
He softens a bit then asks her to take him to the waterfront.
Back at the station, Linden's voice fades back into the open radio channel.
Holder hears her tell Mike about a friend's moment of despair on a nearby bridge.
Catching her reference to his own breakdown, Holder realizes Linden is describing Biltmore Pier.
He and a team of cops rush out of the station.
Mike admits that he dropped Angie off at the veterinarian.
Taking her to a hospital would have landed her back in the foster system.
He then spots Linden's police radio and orders her to pull over.
He marches her at gunpoint to the edge of a pier, but ultimately drops to his knees and tosses the gun into the water.
As he prays for forgiveness, the police arrive with their guns drawn.
She shields him, yelling that he is unarmed.
He is taken into custody unharmed.
In prison, Ray Seward's lawyer (John Shaw) tells him that he was unable to reach Linden.
Seward asks to change his execution method to lethal injection, but is told that it's too late to change his fate.
While being led back to his cell, Seward suffers a panic attack.
In a rare moment of compassion, Francis Becker (Hugh Dillon) calms him.
At the station, Skinner tells Holder that Mike isn't the killer—he was in Mexico City for the period that the 17 murders took place.
Skinner adds that Lyric is not "missing."
Patrol just picked her up on the street.
Furious, Holder finds Bullet out in the hallway and screams at her for misleading him and endangering Linden.
He threatens to put her back in the foster system and kicks her out of the station.
At home, Linden watches Skinner on television as he tells reporters that Mike is no longer a suspect.
Holder visits with some Chinese take-out.
She recounts her experience with Mike to him.
He notices Trisha Seward's case file, and she remarks that Ray Seward will be executed in two days.
Bullet finds Lyric hustling on the street and asks what happened to her the night before.
Lyric yells at her for telling the cops she was missing, then informs her that she isn't a lesbian and is back with Twitch.
Heart broken, Bullet buys drugs from Poochie (Bryce Hodgson), who tells her he just sold drugs to a girl who had her finger chopped off and warns Bullet to be careful.
Becker's wife, Annie (Sonya Salomaa) stops Evan Henderson (Aaron Douglas) in the prison waiting room and tells him Becker hasn't been home in a couple of days.
She asks for consolation but Henderson, seeing her son (Colin MacKechnie) sitting nearby, excuses himself and leaves.
Bullet tracks down Angie, who's about to leave town on a bus.
Bullet pushes her to reveal her kidnapper's identity.
When Angie refuses, Bullet tries to bribe her with the drugs she bought.
Bullet stops at a diner and leaves a voice-mail for Holder, pleading with him to call her back.
She apologizes for the Lyric incident and says she knows who the killer is.
Still at Linden's house, Holder ignores the calls from Bullet.
As they pore over Seward's case file, Linden and Holder remark that Seward really loves his son, judging from family photos of Adrian's first birthday.
As he leaves Linden's house, Holder offers to take the Seward file and look it over, as Linden might have tunnel vision, figuratively speaking.
A more-desperate Seward calls Linden to beg for her help exonerating him.
He hopes that Adrian has additional information and says he will get the foster parents to allow Linden to speak with Adrian again.
At the diner, Bullet continues calling Holder but cannot reach him.
Outside, a car pulls up and its unseen driver watches Bullet through the diner window.
In a July 2013 interview, actor Ben Cotton (Pastor Mike) spoke about his character: "I did a lot [of preparation].
I didn't know what would be coming up in terms of the details, so I was reading the Bible.
And there were some people who I looked at and was like, 'I'll sort of be like that' — but I don't know if I'm allowed to say who.
I wasn't terribly familiar with the world of runaway teens, but I went to YouTube and typed in 'heroin' and 'documentaries' and watched enough hours that I started to have a response to it.
I felt I had to manufacture the story with the girl in Tempe in my mind."
He also spoke of the inspirations for Pastor Mike: "There were people when I was young and in my teens who were trying to help kids, and they did help.
There are people who without whom I don't know where I'd be today.
And I think that's what Pastor Mike is ultimately trying to do.
He's trying to save lives and be compassionate, in a system that doesn't really allow it.
I have a friend who's a schoolteacher who was telling me how you're not allowed to hug the students anymore, and I think that's just unbelievable.
I understand it, I get it, but I had teachers when I was growing up who were so kind and supportive.
It was wonderful."
Sean McKenna of "TVFanatic" stated: "You can certainly add 'Try' to the list of good episode on this roller coaster ride of cops, killers and the heightened drama surrounding the characters involved.
I really can't get over how well done this return season of "The Killing" has been crafted and executed.
If it can deliver a solid ending after all this rising tension and drama, not only will it be the best of the seasons, but it'll have me craving and clamoring for season four." "Try" was watched by 1.52 million total viewers, and received a 0.4 rating in the 18-49 ages demographic, marking slight drops from the previous episode.

Margaret Patrick (1913–1994) was "Ebony" in Ebony and Ivory, the name given to a pair of great-grandmothers in New Jersey, one white and one black, who played classical piano together.
Each had a stroke in 1982 and became partially disabled.
They were introduced to one another the following year and began playing piano together, one hand each.
A reporter covering their story dubbed them "Ebony and Ivory" after the 1982 hit song by Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder.
Patrick grew up in Harlem and started playing the piano at the age of eight and immediately fell in love with it.
At the age of ten, she began to accompany her sister, who played violin and by the time she was twelve, she was accompanying local singers and orchestras.
In 1929, aged 16, she graduated from the Martin Smith Conservatory of Music and was awarded a gold medal for having passed her piano and theory classes with honors.
Patrick married in 1933 and became a piano teacher and taught for 50 years.
She continued accompanying singers and orchestras.
She also played the organ and conducted the choir of a Presbyterian church in the Bronx.
At one point, she directed a choir that sang with Duke Ellington and his orchestra, a highpoint in her life. "I felt elated to work with him," she told "McCall's" magazine.
In January 1982, she had a stroke that left her disabled on her right side and unable to speak.
After months in the hospital, she returned to her home in Englewood, New Jersey, able to speak a little bit, but unable to move her right hand enough to play the piano.
In late 1982, Patrick began going for therapy at Southeast Senior Center for Independent Living.
In early 1983, the program director introduced her to Ruth Eisenberg, another great-grandmother who also had a stroke in 1982.
She had seen Eisenberg sitting at the piano, playing with one hand and looking depressed.
Patrick said, "She told us: 'You have something in common, the piano.
Put your two good hands and your heads together, and see what you can come up with.' " Eisenberg added, "Immediately we got to talking about Chopin.
And then we sat down at the piano and played Chopin's 'Minute Waltz'.
I played the treble with my right hand; she played the bass with her left."
They happily discovered they knew the same music.
They began practicing at the Senior Center and occasionally at Eisenberg's apartment.
In May 1983, a senior citizen center in Teaneck, New Jersey asked them to play at a party.
Their story appeared in local newspapers and they began getting invitations to play at other area hospitals and senior centers.
A local reporter dubbed them "Ebony and Ivory" and the name stuck.
They began to play in other senior citizen facilities, at veterans' homes and hospitals.
Their story went national after being picked up by "The New York Times", which put it on its wire service.
They were on television both in the US and abroad and appeared with Regis Philbin, Geraldo Rivera and David Hartman.
Liberace, who was a fan of "Ebony and Ivory", made his last television appearance on the "Hour Magazine" with Gary Collins and made it a condition of his appearance that if they would bring Patrick and Eisenberg on the program, he would come.
Newsman Morry Alter won an award for his CBS News report on them.
They were featured on "PM Magazine", CNN and "NBC Nightly News", with Tom Brokaw.
Patrick and Eisenberg's story was included in a book by Norman Vincent Peale and in "More True Stories," an ESL reader in its third edition.
It is included in sermons and religious publications in the US and other countries.

Phillip "Pip" Pyle (4 April 1950 – 28 August 2006) was an English-born drummer from Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, who later resided in France.
He is best known for his work in the progressive rock Canterbury scene bands Gong, Hatfield and the North and National Health.
Pyle joined Phil Miller, a friend from kindergarten, and Phil's brother Steve, in forming Bruno's Blues Band, which rapidly evolved into Delivery.
However, Pyle left the band in 1970 after arguing with singer Carol Grimes.
He briefly played in blues band Chicken Shack and Steve Hillage's band Khan.
In 1971, drummer Robert Wyatt asked Pyle to play instead of him on one track of Daevid Allen's solo album "Banana Moon".
From this, Pyle joined Allen in Gong.
While only in the band for eight months, Pyle plays on both "Camembert Électrique" and "Continental Circus".
Pyle was replaced by Laurie Allan, but rejoined Gong for a period in the 1990s.
In 1972, Pyle worked with Paul Jones (who had been singing with Manfred Mann) and with British singer Bridget St John, before founding Hatfield and the North with the Miller brothers in 1972.
Steve Miller was soon replaced in the band and the line-up eventually settled on Pyle, Phil Miller, Richard Sinclair and keyboardist Dave Stewart. "Hatfield and the North" was released in 1974, while a second album, "The Rotters' Club", followed the next year.
As well as drumming, Pyle wrote many of the band's lyrics.
Following Hatfield, Pyle joined Miller and Stewart in National Health as well as playing in other projects, including Soft Heap with Hugh Hopper, Elton Dean and Alan Gowen.
He also played on "Neil's Heavy Concept Album" (1984), a spin-off from the television series "The Young Ones" with which Stewart was involved.
In 1984, Pyle met Sophia Domancich and the two had a relationship for many years.
Pyle also started his own band, Pip Pyle's Equip'Out, including Domancich.
Equip'Out released "Equip'Out", "Up!" and "Instants".
He released one solo album, "Seven Year Itch", in 1998 with guests including Miller, Sinclair, Stewart, Dean (saxello), Hopper (bass), Jakko Jakszyk, Barbara Gaskin, John Greaves (vocals), François Ovide, Fred T. Baker (bass), Paul Rogers (double bass), Lydia Domancich (piano, Sophia's sister) and Didier Malherbe (alto sax).
Pyle also played in Miller's band In Cahoots from 1982 to 2001, appearing on "Cutting Both Ways", "Split Seconds", "Live 86-89", "Live in Japan", "Recent Discoveries", "Parallel" and "Out of the Blue".
His last projects were his group Bash!, featuring the French guitarist Patrice Meyer, Fred Baker on bass and Alex Maguire on keyboards, and a Hatfield and the North reunion (also with Maguire).
Bash! released the live album "Belle Illusion" (Cuneiform Records), but only played five live shows in total (including Progman Cometh), finding it difficult to attract interest from venues.
In 2005 Pyle joined Phil Miller and Richard Sinclair in a re-formation of Hatfield and the North, with Alex Maguire handling the keyboards.
On 29 January, all three were reunited for the first time in fifteen years when Pyle sat in with the Richard Sinclair Band for a few old numbers ("Above And Below", "Share It", "Halfway Between Heaven And Earth" and "Didn't Matter Anyway") during a gig at Whitstable's Horsebridge Arts Centre.
The rejuvenated Hatfield made its official live debut on 18 March 2005 at the Mean Fiddler in London, and a brief tour of Europe followed in June.
More international touring followed in 2005-06, including dates in Japan, Mexico, the US and Europe.
On 26 August 2006 Pyle played his last gig in Feerwerd (Groningen), Netherlands.
He died in Paris on 28 August 2006.

Nothofagus gunnii, the tanglefoot- or deciduous beech, or fagus, is a deciduous shrub endemic to the highlands of Tasmania, Australia.
It was discovered in 1847 by R.C Gunn and evidence exists that it once lived in Antarctica. "N. gunnii" is a small woody tree with a shrubby appearance known to grow up to .
It lives only on mountains due to temperature limitations within the Tasmanian maritime climate and can survive up to heights of .
It grows in alpine and sub-alpine regions in the west to central portions of the state but is absent from the mountains of the northeast.
Though capable of reaching the size of a small tree, it rarely exceeds in height, instead growing as a thick shrub or as a woody ground cover hence its common name of "tanglefoot".
Joseph Dalton Hooker described the tanglefoot beech.
Common names include tanglefoot- or deciduous beech, or fagus, which can also refer to the entire Beech family.
The species was renamed as "Fuscospora gunnii" by New Zealander scientists.
The change in name is controversial, and it is not necessary to accept this change. "Nothofagus gunnii" is a small tree which may grow up to 3 metres tall (growth habit is heavily dependent on the exposure of the site) and has a thick shrubby appearance due to substantial branching.
The alternating leaves are simple and ovate with toothed margins and attached by short petioles.
Leaf lamina is generally <20mm in length and is distinctly 'crinkled'.
It is most easily visually separated from the other Tasmanian species from the same genus, "Nothofagus cunninghamii", by the crinkled appearance of the leaf lamina.
During Autumn and Winter months, the leaves undergo colour change as any other deciduous species does.
The leaves of this deciduous species have an average lifespan of around 5 months.
The leaves are simple and alternate, growing 1 cm long.
The leaf color is bright green, turning yellow, then brilliant red, in autumn.
They are almost circular in shape with deep veins which end in the gaps between the rounded teeth on the leaf.
The plant has separate male and female flowers on the tree.
Both male and female flowers are small and inconspicuous.
The fruit is small (about 6 mm wide) and woody, and contains three small winged nuts.
In most years seed production is poor, but once in a while a 'mast' crop occurs with high germination.
The seeds have a very short viability.
Tanglefoot forests cannot survive fire, and must re-establish from neighbouring areas.
They are very sensitive to changed conditions due to their slow growth.
Under 100 km² of forest remain.
It is the only native deciduous tree in Tasmania, and the only cold climate winter-deciduous tree in Australia. "Nothofagus gunnii" is endemic to Tasmania and restricted to high altitude and relatively high rainfall areas with no recent fire activity.
It was discovered at the summit of Mt Olympus in central Tasmania and is known to live also at several locations within the Mt Field national park and on Cradle mountain.
It is considered a paleoendemic species to Tasmania as macrofossils have been discovered within Oligocene sediments both in Tasmania and Antarctica. "Nothofagus gunnii" required around 1,800 mm of rain spread throughout the year to be cultivated, cool temperatures not below -10 °C and also requires full sun.
It grows in deep peaty soils.
It is best grown from fresh seed collected in a 'mast' year, germinating in a few weeks.
It is believed that a beneficial mycorrhyzal fungus is required for the long term success of the plant.
Cuttings can be struck, taken in late winter before bud burst. "Nothofagus gunnii" is rarely seen in cultivation due to its poor performance and slow growth.
It is believed to be a candidate plant for bonsai. "Nothofagus gunnii" exists only in alpine and sub-alpine environments on mountains within Tasmania.
The species is generally limited to heights above due to the temperature and relatively short snow lie duration within the Tasmanian oceanic climate.
It may live as a dominant low shrubby tree on open, generally sloping, rocky ground. "F. gunnii" habitation is severely limited by fire regimes as it is extremely fire sensitive and will not survive burning.
Local extinctions of the species have been attributed to fire in the Denison Range.
Despite the limited range of "Nothofagus gunnii", the species is not listed as endangered.
Although very few data are recorded about reproductive methods of "F. gunnii", it may be assumed that seeds are wind dispersed and that the species are mast seeders as is displayed in similar species such as "Nothofagus cunninghamii".
Oceanside School District is a school district in Oceanside, New York.
There are 854 full-time employees, of which 440 are teachers.
The International School for Advanced Studies (, SISSA) is an international, state supported, post-graduate teaching and research institute, located in Trieste, Italy.
SISSA is active in the fields of mathematics, physics and neuroscience, offering both undergraduate and post-graduate courses.
Each year about 70 PhD students are admitted to SISSA based on their scientific qualifications.
SISSA also runs master programs in the same areas, in collaboration with both Italian and other European universities.
SISSA was founded in 1978, as a part of the reconstruction following the Friuli earthquake of 1976.
Although the city of Trieste itself did not suffer any damage, physicist Paolo Budinich asked and obtained from the Italian government to include in the interventions the institution of a new, post-graduate teaching and research institute, modeled on the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa.
The school became operative with a PhD course in theoretical physics, and Budinich himself was appointed as general director.
In 1986, Budinich left his position to Daniele Amati, who at the time was at the head of the theoretical division at CERN.
Under his leadership, SISSA expanded its teaching and research activity towards the field of neuroscience, and instituted a new interdisciplinary laboratory aiming at connecting humanities and scientific studies.
From 2001 to 2004, the director was the Italian geneticist Edoardo Boncinelli, who fostered the development of the existing research areas.
Other directors were appointed in the following years, which saw the strengthening of SISSA collaboration with other Italian and European universities in offering master's degree programs in the three areas of the School (mathematics, physics and neuroscience).
The physicist Stefano Ruffo, the current director, was appointed in 2015.
He signed a partnership with the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology to set up a new PhD program in Molecular Biology, with teaching activity organized by both institutions.
SISSA has the following research groups: In addition, there is the "Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Natural and Humanistic Sciences" (now LISNU - Laboratorio Interdisciplinare Scienze Naturali e Umanistiche), which is endowed with the task of making connections between science, humanities, and the public.
It currently offers a course in Scientific Communication and Scientific journalism.
SISSA also enjoys special teaching and scientific links with the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology and the "Elettra" Synchrotron Light Laboratory.
The School provides students and members of other scientific institutions in the Trieste area with specialised Mathematics and Physics libraries, a parallel Calculus Centre, several cellular neurobiology laboratories, a confocal microscopy and an electronic microscopy laboratory and multiple cognitive neuroscience laboratories.
In the school premises there is also a canteen, a kindergarten and a gym, open to SISSA staff and students.
In the school garden there is an open air theatre, used for shows, conferences and activities that aim to promote science to a wider public.
Recently SISSA, in partnership with the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, built a new supercomputing centre in Miramare, near Trieste, with about 100 teraFLOPS of computing power.
According to the last aggregate data issued by ANVUR - the Italian National Agency for the Evaluation of the University and Research Systems - SISSA ranks: Since July 13, 2010 the campus has been located near Opicina, where it is easily accessible by Opicina tramway.
Up to 2010 SISSA administrative offices and all research sectors were located near the Miramare Park, about 10 kilometres from the city of Trieste.
Miramare park still hosts the ICTP (International Center for Theoretical Physics) and the Department of Theoretical Physics of the University of Trieste.
Atlantic City International Airport is a joint civil-military airport northwest of Atlantic City, New Jersey, in Egg Harbor Township, the Pomona section of Galloway Township and in Hamilton Township.
The airport is accessible via Exit 9 on the Atlantic City Expressway.
The facility is operated by the South Jersey Transportation Authority (SJTA) and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which performs select management functions.
Most of the land is owned by the Federal Aviation Administration and leased to the SJTA, while the SJTA owns the terminal building.
The facility also is a base for the New Jersey Air National Guard's 177th Fighter Wing operating the F-16C/D Fighting Falcon, and the United States Coast Guard's Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City operating the HH-65 Dolphin.
The airport is next to the FAA's William J. Hughes Technical Center, a major research and testing hub for the Federal Aviation Administration and a training center for the Federal Air Marshal Service.
It was also a designated alternative landing site for the Space Shuttle.
The airport is served by Spirit Airlines which operates Airbus A319, Airbus A320 and Airbus A321 jetliners.
Additionally, Caesars Entertainment has flights to cities east of the Mississippi River on its Total Rewards Air.
This is offered as a scheduled charter year-round.
United Airlines operated a series of flights starting in April, 2014, but decided the flights were not viable and discontinued service on December 3, 2014.
The South Jersey Transportation Authority has outlined plans for massive terminal expansions (on top of current initiatives) which might be needed if more airlines serve the airport.
Passenger traffic at the airport in 2011 was 1,404,119, making it the 102nd busiest airport in the country.
The SJTA owns a small area around the terminal and leases runways and other land from the FAA.
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in March 2013 ordered a takeover of the airport's operations by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
In 1942, Naval Air Station Atlantic City was built on of leased private land in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey.
Its purpose was to train various carrier air groups consisting of fighter, bomber and torpedo squadrons.
In August 1943, NAS Atlantic City changed its mission to strictly fighter training, consisting of low and high altitude gunnery tactics, field carrier landing practice (FCLP), carrier qualifications (CQ), bombing, formation tactics, fighter direction, night operations and an associated ground school curriculum.
NAS Atlantic City was decommissioned in June 1958 and transferred to the Airways Modernization Board (AMB), later taken over by the FAA.
In November 1958 the then-Federal Aviation Agency, now Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), took over operations of the AMB.
The lease transferred to the FAA and was sold for $55,000.
Atlantic City decided to retain 84 of the 4,312 acres.
The FAA expanded the former U.S. Navy land parcel to about and established the National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center research facility that eventually became the William J. Hughes Technical Center.
The South Jersey Transportation Authority (SJTA) initially leased portions of the airport from the FAA and now serves as the airport owner and operator of the facility.
When the Navy departed in 1958, the then-177th Fighter Squadron of the New Jersey Air National Guard relocated to Atlantic City from their former base at Newark International Airport with their F-84F Thunderstreak aircraft.
Establishing an Air National Guard base on the site of the former naval air station.
The current 177th Fighter Wing of the New Jersey Air National Guard has been at this location ever since.
During the 1960s and early 1970s, the active duty U.S. Air Force's 95th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, stationed at Dover AFB, Delaware, maintained an Operating Location and Alert Detachment of F-106 Delta Darts at Atlantic City ANGB on 24-hour alert.
After the 177th Fighter Wing reequipped with the F-106 in 1973, the 177th took on the air defence alert mission.
In the fall of 1983, American International Airways attempted to operate a small hub at the airport with Douglas DC-9-30 jetliners with passenger service to Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Orlando, Pittsburgh, Tampa and West Palm Beach.
ACY has also had US Airways jet service to Pittsburgh as well as US Airways Express turboprops to Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, and Continental Express turboprops and regional jets to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.
This regional jet service for Continental Airlines was operated by ExpressJet Airlines with Embraer ERJs.
On July 26, 1969, TWA flight 5787, a Boeing 707-331C crashed while performing a practice missed approach with an engine out on runway 13.
There was a total of five fatalities; a flight instructor, flight engineer and three line captains undergoing aircrew recurrency training.
The NTSB subsequently attributed the cause of the accident to, "loss of directional control, which resulted from the intentional shutdown of the pumps supplying hydraulic pressure to the rudder without a concurrent restoration of power on the No. 4 engine."
Delta Air Lines also had flights to Boston on Delta Connection regional jets operated by Atlantic Coast Airlines until a few years ago.
In addition, Delta Connection via its partner Comair operated flights to Cincinnati and Orlando, which ended on May 1, 2007.
WestJet had Boeing 737 jetliner flights from ACY to Toronto, but ended them on May 9, 2010, leaving the airport with no international service.
On April 1, 2014, United Airlines started service from Atlantic City to Chicago–O'Hare and Houston, but the service was discontinued on December 3, 2014.
Air Canada had seasonal flights to Toronto in the Summer of 2015, but has decided not to return in the Summer of 2016, once again leaving the airport without international scheduled flights.
Since 1958, the airport has been home to Atlantic City Air National Guard Base and the 177th Fighter Wing (177 FW), an Air Combat Command (ACC)-gained unit of the New Jersey Air National Guard, operating the F-16C/D Fighting Falcon.
Since October 1998, the wing has had an active involvement in Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Southern Watch, Operation Northern Watch, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.
As an Air National Guard unit, the 177 FW has dual federal (USAF augmentation) and state (support to New Jersey) missions.
ACY is also home to Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City.
CGAS Atlantic City was opened on May 18, 1998, and is the newest and largest single airframe unit and facility of the Coast Guard's air stations.
It is a product of the merging of the former CGAS Brooklyn/Floyd Bennett Field, NY and Group Air Station Cape May, NJ into one unit.
CGAS Atlantic City consists of 10 HH-65C Dolphin helicopters and it maintains two Dolphin helicopters in 30-minute response status.
Approximately, 250 aviation personnel comprise the facility's full-time staff, augmented by additional part-time Coast Guard Reserve and Coast Guard Auxiliary personnel.
CGAS Atlantic City also provides aircrews and aircraft to the Washington, D.C. area as part of Operation Noble Eagle, the Department of Defense USNORTHCOM / NORAD mission to protect U.S. airspace and, in this case, specifically around the nation's capital.
Atlantic City International Airport covers at an elevation of 75 feet (23 m) above mean sea level.
It has two runways: 4/22 is 6,144 by 150 feet (1,873 x 46 m) asphalt/concrete; 13/31 is 10,000 by 150 feet (3,048 x 46 m) asphalt.
Atlantic City International Airport has one terminal.
Several charter carriers operate out of the terminal, along with scheduled flights of Spirit Airlines.
The terminal has a small layout, making it an alternative to Philadelphia International Airport or Newark Liberty International Airport.
Passengers enter the terminal on the lower-level which has the check-in counters, a small grill and a gift shop.
Baggage claim is on this level, with three carousels.
After check-in, passengers proceed to the security checkpoint, also on this level.
After the security checkpoint, stairs and escalators lead to the departures level.
The 10 gates are here, with several open for use by charters and several used by the scheduled carriers.
All gates are uniform, with no customization by the airlines.
Also on the second level is a café, a bar and a newsstand.
Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the terminal.
Atlantic City International Airport has a six-story parking garage with a covered walkway within steps to the terminal building.
Surface parking is within walking distance and shuttle service is provided from the economy parking area to the terminal building.
The parking garage has rental car facilities for Enterprise, Hertz, Avis and Budget.
Taxi service is available at curbside and a shuttle service is provided by the Atlantic City Jitney Association, located in the airport terminal, outside of baggage claim.
A shuttle bus brings passengers to the Egg Harbor City rail station, which provides service to the Atlantic City Line, which runs between the 30th Street Station in Philadelphia to the Atlantic City Rail Terminal.
Shuttles to the Egg Harbor rail station connect to shuttles to the visitor's center at the FAA Technical Center and the Stockton University, as well as bus lines to the PATCO Speedline at the Lindenwold station.
The South Jersey Transportation Authority will begin construction of a new aircraft rescue and firefighting station at Atlantic City International Airport.
The new 45,000 square foot building will feature vehicle bays, administrative and staff living areas, enhanced equipment and apparatus facilities as well as room for training requirements.
Work began in August 2011 upgrading the passenger screening facilities at airport.
The checkpoint expansion will consist of the addition of three new screening lanes as well as improvements to the airport's infrastructure.
The TSA will supply the new screening equipment for the expanded area.
The expansion also includes development of a Federal Inspection Services station.
Under this project, equipment will include additional passenger loading bridges and gates, new technological upgrades, baggage carousel improvements, added retail space and improved check-in capabilities.
A bill has been submitted in the New Jersey legislature that would provide for a rail station at the airport that would become a part of NJ Transit's Atlantic City Line.
No specific funding or budget has been drawn up, but estimates for the project are in the range of $25 million to $30 million.
In 2017 the airport had 53,506 aircraft operations, an average of 147 per day: 41% military, 15% scheduled commercial, 35% general aviation and 9% air taxi. 46 aircraft were then based at this airport: 24% single-engine, 4% jet, 24% helicopter and 48% military.
A technology park housing Next Generation Air Transportation System is currently under construction on the airport property on a lot near Amelia Earhart Boulevard and Delilah Road.
The seven-building complex is set to contain of offices, laboratories and research facilities.
The park will focus on developing new computer equipment that will transform the country's air-traffic control program into a satellite-based system.
The first of the buildings was originally set to open in April 2012 and will contain a lab for the FAA as well as research space for other tenants.
A second office park, the NextGen International Aviation Center for Excellence, is set to be built in nearby Hamilton Township, adjacent to the Hamilton Mall and Atlantic City Race Course, the latter of which is set to be renovated.
A new transportation center at the site would transfer workers between the two complexes.
In 2009, the SJTA awarded a contract to a Ventnor City-based construction firm to construct a hotel on a property leased from the FAA at the intersection of Tilton and Delilah Roads.
Plans call for a 135-room hotel including some extended-stay suites, about of conference space, of retail space and possibly a restaurant.
The hotel would be built to accommodate a new flood of business travelers brought by the NextGen technical park.
The SJTA revealed plans for a major road improvement project that would link the airport directly to the Atlantic City Expressway, with construction beginning in 2013.
The plan includes new ramps with two overpasses over the expressway.
The road would connect Amelia Earhart Boulevard with a bridge over Airport Circle.
Plans also call for building a service road with another overpass that would provide access to Delilah Road.
Another project involves the installation of an overpass at the end of Amelia Earhart Boulevard next to the entrance to the FAA tech center.
The proposed roadway would intrude upon a small section of a mobile home park and land owned by Egg Harbor Township.
The project was delayed due to a lack of financing.
The 2018 Statewide Transportation Improvement Program included the direct connector, with an estimated cost of $60 million, to be built from 2019 to 2020.
In February 2011, the New Jersey Legislature authorized the Atlantic City Tourism District, which would promote continued development of tourism in the region.
A provision included the potential transfer of operations for ACY to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The Khumalo are an African clan that originated in northern KwaZulu, South Africa.
The Khumalos are part of a group of Zulus and Ngunis known as the Mtungwa.
Others include the Blose and Mabaso, located between the Ndwandwe and the Mthethwa.
Their most famous issue was Mzilikazi, an influential figure in the mfecane, and founder of the Northern Ndebele nation.
Until the rise of Zwide and the Ndwandwes, life was a simple affair and the Khumalos located at Mkhuze had the best that the land which would become Zululand had to offer: plenty of water, fertile soil and grazing ground.
But the Khumalos in the early nineteenth century would have to lose their neutrality and choose a side, and this they postponed for as long as they could.
To please the Ndwandwe, Mashobana – a Khumalo chief – married the daughter of the Ndwandwe chief Zwide and sired a son, Mzilikazi.
The Ndwandwes are amaNguni aseMbo, though all spoke a very similar language (all Nguni languages are similar).
When Mashobane did not tell Zwide about patrolling Mthethwa amabutho (soldiers), Zwide had Mashobana killed, and the leadership of the Khumalo fell to Mzilikazi.
Mzilikazi immediately did not trust his grandfather, Zwide, and took fifty warriors to join Shaka.
Shaka was overjoyed because the Khumalos would be useful spies on Zwide and the Ndwandwes.
After a few battles, Shaka gave Mzilikazi the extraordinary honour of being chief of the Khumalos and to remain semi-independent from the Zulu, if Zwide could be defeated.
This caused immense jealousy amongst those who had been with Shaka for many years, but as warriors none such as Shaka had realised their equal in Mzilikazi.
All intelligence for the defeat of Zwide was collected by Mzilikazi.
Hence, when Zwide was defeated Shaka rightly acknowledged he could not have done it without Mzilikazi and presented him with an ivory axe.
There were only two such axes – one for Shaka and one for Mzilikazi.
Shaka himself placed the plumes on Mzilikazi's head after Zwide was vanquished.
The Khumalos returned to peace in their ancestral homeland.
This peace lasted until Shaka asked Mzilikazi to test a tribe to the north of the Khumalo, belonging to one Raninsi a Sotho.
After the defeat of Raninsi, Mzilikazi refused to hand over the cattle to Shaka.
Shaka, loving Mzilikazi, did nothing about it.
His generals however, long disliking Mzilikazi, pressed for action, and thus a first force was sent to teach Mzilikazi a lesson.
The force was soundly beaten by Mzilikazi's 500 warriors, compared to the Zulus' 3,000 warriors (though Mzilikazi had the cover of the mountains).
This made Mzilikazi the only warrior to have ever defeated Shaka in battle.
Shaka did not seem to mind, but he reluctantly sent his veteran division, the Ufasimbi, to rid themselves of Mzilikazi and the embarrassing situation.
Mzilikazi, left with only three hundred warriors who were grossly out-numbered, and betrayed by his brother, Zeni, who had wanted Mzilikazi's position for himself, was defeated.
From there the Khumalos would be scattered across southern Africa, some becoming the Sotho, and some joining other groups such as the Tswana, but the vast majority remained Zulu and Mthwakazi. "Mthwakazi" is what the Ndebeles call themselves.
"Matabele" is a name originating from white settlers, itself coming from "Tebele", a name given to all Zulus by the Sotho at that time.
The Ndebeles are Mthwakazi, drawing strength and wisdom from King Mzilikazi.
The Babylon by Bus Tour was a concert tour organised to support the album "Babylon by Bus" by Bob Marley & The Wailers.
It was also to popularize Marley and reggae music in Asia and Oceania.
The tour started in Japan on 5 April 1979, and ended in Honolulu, Hawaii, on 6 May 1979.
The tour should have started with two shows in Ivory Coast in mid-March, but both concerts had been cancelled due to unknown reasons.
The first leg led Marley through Japan where he performed for the first time, the second leg took place in various Oceanian places (New Zealand, Australia, Hawaii).
It was Marley's only tour including concerts in Asia and Oceania.
After the tour Marley performed two historical concerts: his last performance in Jamaica, at the Reggae Sunsplash, and at the Amandla Festival in Boston's Harvard Stadium where he made a powerful and historical speech.
The standard setlist of the tour mostly looked like the following: The setlist was very similar to that from the previous Kaya Tour, but in different order.
There were also performances of an earlier song, "Punky Reggae Party", which is not featured on any of Marley's Island albums released at that time, but was released as a single in 1977.
From show to show sometimes an additional song was edged in the middle of the setlist, like "Stir It Up", "Punky Reggae Party" or "Natty Dread".
Live performances of each of these songs happened very rarely during the tour.
Pennsylvania Route 873 (PA 873) is a north-south, two-lane road mainly located in northern Lehigh County, Pennsylvania with a small section in Northampton County.
Its southern terminus is at PA 309 in Schnecksville.
Its northern terminus is at PA 248 in the Lehigh Township hamlet of Weiders Crossing.
The route runs through rural areas in northern Lehigh County, intersecting the western terminus of PA 329 in Neffs.
PA 873 passes through Slatington as Main Street before it crosses the Lehigh River into Northampton County and immediately reaches its northern terminus south of Lehigh Gap in Blue Mountain.
The road between Schnecksville and Lehigh Gap was originally designated part of Legislative Route 163 in 1911.
This section of road became part of U.S. Route 309 (US 309) when the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926.
In the late 1920s, PA 22 and PA 130 were briefly marked concurrent with US 309 at different times.
In the 1950s, US 309 was moved to a new alignment to the west, and part of PA 29 was designated onto the road between Schnecksville and Lehigh Gap.
PA 873 was designated onto this road on May 9, 1966 after PA 29 was split into two segments.
PA 873 begins at an intersection with PA 309 in the community of Schnecksville in North Whitehall Township, Lehigh County.
From this intersection, the route heads north on a two-lane undivided road, passing a mix of homes and businesses.
The road turns northeast and passes residences and fields before intersecting the western terminus of PA 329.
From here, PA 873 continues north into the residential community of Neffs before curving northwest and entering Washington Township.
In this area, the road passes through a mix of housing developments and farmland as it turns north and passes over I-476 (Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension).
The route continues through rural areas of homes and woods prior to crossing into the borough of Slatington.
Here, PA 873 becomes Main Street and is lined with residences before reaching the commercial downtown, where the road makes a sharp turn to the east.
The route turns north onto Walnut Street and passes more businesses before running past a few homes a short distance to the west of Slatington Airport.
PA 873 leaves Slatington for Washington Township again and runs through wooded areas with some residences.
The route turns northeast, with the Appalachian Trail joining the road, and crosses the Lehigh River into Lehigh Township in Northampton County, where it passes over Norfolk Southern's Lehigh Line before ending at PA 248 at the base of Blue Mountain south of Lehigh Gap.
The Appalachian Trail turns south onto PA 248 at this point.
When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 873 was incorporated as part of Legislative Route 163, which ran between Allentown and Mauch Chunk (present-day Jim Thorpe).
With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the section of road between Schnecksville and Lehigh Gap was designated as part of US 309, a route that ran from Philadelphia north to Wilkes-Barre.
At this time, the entire road was paved.
PA 22 was designated concurrent with US 309 on this stretch of road in 1927.
A year later, PA 130 replaced the PA 22 designation along US 309.
By 1930, the concurrent PA 130 designation was removed along this stretch of US 309, which intersected PA 29 in Schnecksville and PA 45 in Lehigh Gap.
US 309 was shifted west to a new alignment between Allentown and Hazleton in the 1950s, and PA 29 was shifted east to follow the road running between Schnecksville and Lehigh Gap.
On May 9, 1966, the PA 29 designation between Allentown and West Nanticoke was removed, splitting the route into two segments.
As a result, PA 873 was designated onto the former alignment of PA 29 between US 309 (now PA 309) in Schnecksville and PA 248 (which replaced PA 45) in Lehigh Gap.
St. Dominic's Church in San Francisco, California, is a Roman Catholic parish situated in the Western Addition neighborhood, located at the corner of Bush and Steiner Streets.
The parish was established by the Dominican order in 1873, and the current church, built in the Gothic style, was finished in 1928.
In addition to a large parish membership, St. Dominic's Church has one of the most active Catholic Young Adults Groups in the Archdiocese of San Francisco.
The Church gave its name to Van Morrison's hit 1972 studio album, Saint Dominic's Preview.
Dominicans first came to San Francisco in 1850 when the Most Reverend Joseph Sadoc Alemany, Father Sadoc Francis Vilarrasa and Mary Goemere arrived from Spain via several other appointments in the United States.
Bishop Alemany, who in 1840 completed his studies in sacred theology in Rome at the College of St. Thomas, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, "Angelicum", had been appointed Bishop of Monterey and invited Fr.
Vilarrasa to accompany him to California.
The Archdiocese of San Francisco was created in 1853 and Archbishop Alemany was its first incumbent.
The first Dominican Priory in San Francisco was established in 1863 at Van Ness and Broadway to provide a center for the friars who were given charge of the new parish of Saint Brigid.
The Dominicans served there until 1875 when it was transferred to diocesan clergy.
During this time, Dominicans served the parishes of Saint Francis of Assisi and Notre Dame des Victoires as well.
In 1863, the Dominican order paid $6,000 for the city block bounded by Steiner, Bush, Pierce and Pine Streets.
During 1872 and 1873, Fr.
Vilarrasa and the Provincial Council approved the expenditure of $25,000 to build a priory and a church.
The first Saint Dominic's, a small church at the corner of Bush and Steiner Streets, was blessed on June 29, 1873.
The Priory of Saint Dominic was formally established in 1876.
By 1880, it was apparent that the church was too small for its rapidly growing congregation.
Plans were drawn for a much larger church to be built of brick on the same site.
The first church was moved to a location on Pine Street where it served as a parish hall.
Although the cornerstone of the second church was laid in 1883, years of financial hardship followed and the church did not open until 1887 and was not completed for several years after.
It served the parish until April 18, 1906.
During the months following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, parishioners gathered for Mass outdoors until, in October 1906, a wooden church opened on the Pierce Street side of the block.
This "temporary" Saint Dominic's was to remain in use as a church until 1928 and as a parish hall until the 1960s.
Work did not begin on the fourth Saint Dominic's until 1923.
After construction was finished in 1928, the new church, designed by Mr. Arnold Constable, was blessed by Archbishop Hanna.
Even then, work continued for many years as the building we know now was brought to completion at the time of Saint Dominic's centennial celebration in 1973.
The current, gothic-style church shows both English & French influences in its design and construction, leaning more towards the English.
One of the most notable extant French influences is the semi-circular apse at the western end of the church.
The Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 destroyed another of the primary French features: the beautiful octagonal "lantern" of Saint Dominic's tower.
The tower itself was severely damaged, but was repaired and strengthened during the two months the church was closed.
Much of the decorative work on the ceiling beams of the church fell during the quake and the remainder was removed for the safety of the parishioners.
As early as 1984, engineering tests had determined that the church was seismically unstable.
Work began immediately to find a solution and a way to pay for it.
The Saint Dominic's Preservation and Restoration Project began its work in 1986.
By June 1991, sufficient funds had been raised to begin the construction of nine flying buttresses that rise from concrete piers deep underground and soar to connect at a ring beam that girdles the church at the roof line.
This medieval concept was found to be the best solution to a late 20th-century problem.
But the cost was in 1992 dollars: $6.6 million.
Parishioners and friends from around the world confirmed the importance of this Church by raising all the needed funds.
Construction was completed in July 1992, and Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco dedicated Saint Dominic's Church on August 1, 1992.
Palais Todesco is a "Ringstraßenpalais" in Vienna, Austria, constructed from 1861 to 1864 on plans by architect Theophil Hansen.
It was built for the aristocratic Todesco family.
One of the inhabitants was Baroness Sophie von Todesco, who established a renowned salon for artists and intellectuals.
The palace served as the headquarters of the Austrian People's Party from 1947 to 1995.
A municipal district is an administrative entity comprising a clearly defined territory and its population.
It can refer to a city, town, village or a small grouping of them, or a rural area.
In Canada, municipal districts are a type of rural municipality within the Province of Alberta governed by elected councils with the mandate to administer rural areas that can include farmlands, resource areas and unincorporated hamlets and rural residential subdivisions.
Statistics Canada recognizes Alberta's 64 municipal districts as a type of census subdivision for statistical purposes.
Statistics Canada also refers to Nova Scotia's 12 district municipalities as municipal districts for census subdivision purposes.
The City of Flin Flon in Manitoba also held a municipal district status between 1933 and 1946.
In the Dominican Republic, when a municipality consists of more than one urban center, those beside the municipalities seat can be elevated to the status of a municipal district ("distrito municipal").
A municipal council ("Junta Municipal") for such a municipal district is nominated by the municipal council of the municipality to which it belongs (Ley 3455 Titulo I Capitulo IV).
In Ireland, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 brought in a system of municipal districts for local government purposes from 1 June 2014 following local elections in May, replacing town and borough councils.
The districts are second-tier units below counties, with the exception of the Dublin Region and Cork and Galway cities which retained their existing local government structures.
The districts act as constituencies for county councils, with councillors being simultaneously elected to both bodies.
Some municipal districts are titled "borough districts" (Clonmel, Drogheda, Sligo and Wexford) or "metropolitan districts" (Limerick and Waterford), though they have no additional powers.
In Russia, municipal districts are a form of local self-government, and one of the types of municipal formations.
They are usually (but not always) formed within the borders of existing administrative districts.
Pono is a Hawaiian word commonly rendered as "righteousness".
For instance, the Hawaii state motto: "Ua Mau ke Ea o ka Āina i ka Pono" or "The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness". "Pono" is a notably polysemous term.
Mary Kawena Pukui's and Samuel Hoyt Elbert's Hawaiian dictionary gives six meanings and 83 English translation equivalents.
The word has strong cultural and spiritual connotations of "a state of harmony or balance", and is the aim of the Hoʻoponopono practice.
Pono is often used as in affirmative prayers, especially within Kanaka Maoli healing arts and the Hawaiian Sovereignty Movement.
Arthur Sydney Rowe (1 September 1906 – 5 November 1993) was an English footballer, and later manager, who played as a centre half.
He was the first manager to lead Tottenham Hotspur to the First Division Championship title in 1951.
He also 'invented' the successful "one-two" method of play.
Rowe was born in Tottenham and began his career at Tottenham Hotspur's nursery club Northfleet United as an amateur in 1923, before becoming a professional with "Spurs" in 1929.
He also appeared as an amateur for Cheshunt in 1920.
He was a Tottenham player for eight seasons, after making his debut in 1931, in which time he played 201 games, in all competitions, and earned his single cap for the England team.
He was forced to retire in 1939 due to a cartilage injury.
After finishing his career as a player Rowe took a coaching job in Hungary although this was halted due to the outbreak of World War II.
He returned to Britain and joined the military as a physical training instructor.
He joined Chelmsford City, as secretary-manager, in 1945 and made the club into a leading non-league team.
Tottenham were in the second division when Rowe returned to the club as manager in 1949 and his task was to gain promotion.
This was achieved by becoming Champions and the following season the First Division Championship was won as well.
These back-to-back championships made Spurs the first post-war team to win back-to-back titles.
This was achieved through the use of 'Push and run' football.
Rowe was forced to resign as Tottenham manager in 1955 due to health issues.
After leaving Tottenham, Rowe took time off to recover and joined Crystal Palace in November 1958 as assistant to George Smith.
He was promoted to manager when Smith resigned in April 1960 bringing the club a promotion to Division Three in the 1960–61 season.
The club consolidated its position in Division Three in 1961–62, but a poor start to the next season coincided with failing health for Rowe and he resigned in December 1962 to be replaced by assistant manager Dick Graham.
Rowe returned to assist Graham in the 1963–64 season (when Palace were promoted to Division Two) and when Graham was dismissed by Palace in 1966, Rowe was appointed caretaker-manager.
After Bert Head was appointed as manager later in 1966, Rowe continued with Palace in a scouting capacity.
He subsequently managed the Hall of Fame in London and also assisted Leyton Orient briefly in 1972.
Arthur Rowe died on 5 November 1993 in Wallington, Surrey aged 87.
The San Juan Capistrano Invitational Handicap is an American invitational handicap Thoroughbred horse race run annually on turf at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California.
It is North America's longest graded stakes race.
Open to horses age four and older, the Grade III event currently offers a purse of $100,000.
Run during the second half of April as the traditional closing-day feature at Santa Anita Park, usually at about miles (about 2.74 km) it is one of the longest grass race in America.
Since 1965 it has been an invitational handicap.
It has now downgraded from a Grade II to a Grade III race and run in late June due to the reshuffling of events inherited from the closure of Hollywood Park Racetrack in 2014.
Inaugurated in 1935, for 1940 only it was limited to three-year-olds and for three-year-olds and older in all other years prior to 1968.
From its inception through 1953, the race was contested on dirt, then in 1954 it was converted to a turf event.
Over the years, it has been run at various distances: The San Juan Capistrano is run around four turns, and begins at the top of Santa Anita's downhill chute, normally used for 6 1/2 furlong sprint races.
From the start point, horses begin their descent down the hill.
Within the first two furlongs of the race, horses turn right - one of only two locations in North American horse racing that a right turn is used (the other is at Kentucky Downs).
After a brief straight run, there is a gentle turn to the left until the horses cross the dirt course and enter the main turf oval.
Horses then run one full lap of the turf course to complete the distance.
In 2016 the Santa Anita's downhill chute was under repair and the race was run on the flat turf oval, at .
In 1964, the San Juan Capistrano Invitational Handicap was run in two divisions.
With the increasing emphasis on speed horses bred to compete in the Kentucky Derby and Breeders' Cup Classic distance of miles on dirt, during the last two decades longer races run on grass or dirt in North America have been in decline.
Once a Grade I event, the about miles San Juan Capistrano Invitational Handicap now holds a Grade III classification.
Since 2007, the winner of the San Juan Capistrano has received ballot free entry into Australia's greatest horse race and the staying championship of the world, the Melbourne Cup.
As of 2008, no San Juan Capistrano winner has made the trip to Flemington for the Melbourne Cup.
At age eight, Niarkos (1968) and Mashkour (1991) are the oldest horses to win the event.
The March 12, 1966, edition of the San Juan Capistrano Invitational Handicap was seen by 60,792 fans, the largest crowd of the season, who turned out to say farewell to retiring U.S.
Racing Hall of Fame jockey Johnny Longden.
Without ever using the whip as he always did, Longden guided George Royal from fifteen lengths back in last place to a photo-finish win.
Speed record: Most wins: Most wins by a jockey: Most wins by a trainer: Most wins by an owner: † In 1970 there was a dead heat for first.

A battery regenerator is a device that restores capacity to lead-acid batteries, extending their effective lifespan.
They are also known as desulphators, reconditioners or pulse conditioning devices.
When batteries are stored in an uncharged state for an extended period, lead-sulfur deposits form and harden on the lead plates inside the battery.
This causes what is known as a "sulfated battery", which will no longer charge to its original capacity.
Regenerators send pulses of electric current through the battery, which in some cases may cause the sulfate to flake off the plates and eventually dissolve.
Conventional lead–acid batteries consist of a number of plates of lead and lead dioxide suspended in a cell filled with weak sulfuric acid.
Lead oxide reacts with the sulfur and oxygen in the acid to give up an electron, leaving the plate positively charged and producing lead sulfate.
Lead reacts with the acid by taking in two electrons, leaving it negative while also producing lead sulfate.
The two chemical processes continue as long as an external circuit is available to allow the electrons to flow back into the positive plates, but reaches equilibrium quickly when the battery is disconnected from the circuit.
Each complete reaction produces about 2.11V.
A typical 12V battery consists of six individual "cells" wired together in a single box, producing 13.2V when fully charged.
As a battery is discharged the density of lead sulfate in solution increases.
In common designs, it reaches a critical density when discharged to about 75% depth of discharge, or below.
For instance, a 12V battery with a 100 Ampere-hour (Ah) capacity will reach this density when 25 Ah (300 Wh) or more have been drawn from the battery.
At this point, the lead sulfate will begin to precipitate out of solution onto the battery plates, forming a spongy film.
If the battery is immediately recharged, the film will dissolve back into the acid.
If the battery is stored or repeatedly operated in this partially charged state for an extended period, the film will slowly crystallize into a solid.
This process of "sulfation" takes time, so it only has a chance to build to significant levels if the battery is repeatedly discharged below this critical level.
There are numerous other conditions that can lead to the same problem developing.
Batteries also have a small amount of internal resistance that will discharge the battery even when it is disconnected.
If a battery is left disconnected, any internal charge will drain away slowly and eventually reach the critical point.
From then on the film will develop and thicken.
This is the reason batteries will be found to charge poorly or not at all if left in storage for a long period of time.
Conventional battery chargers use a one-, two-, or three-stage process to recharge the battery, with switched-mode power supply include more stages in order to fill the battery more rapidly and completely.
Common to almost all chargers, including non-switched models, is the middle stage, normally known as "absorption".
In this mode the charger holds a steady voltage slightly above that of a filled battery, in order to push current into the cells.
As the battery fills, its internal voltage rises towards the fixed voltage being supplied to it, and the rate of current flow slows.
Eventually the charger will turn off when the current drops below a pre-set threshold.
A sulfated battery has higher electrical resistance than an unsulfated battery of identical construction.
As related by Ohm's law, current is the ratio of voltage to resistance, so a sulfated battery will have lower current flow.
As the charging process continues, such a battery will reach the charger's preset cut-off more rapidly, long before it has had time to accept a complete charge.
In this case the battery charger indicates the charge cycle is complete, but the battery actually holds very little energy.
To the user, it appears that the battery is dying.
The lead sulfate layer can be dissolved back into solution by applying much higher voltages.
Normally, running high voltage into a battery will cause it to rapidly heat and potentially causing thermal runaway which may cause it to explode.
Some battery conditioners use short pulses of high voltage, too short to cause significant current flow, but long enough to reverse the crystallization process.
However, long-term use of high-voltage pulses has been shown to damage the battery plates on wet batteries, and on sealed lead–acid batteries will cause the battery to dry out and fail.
The latest developments in battery regeneration products use frequency pulses as opposed to high voltages to dissolve the sulfate build-up back into the electrolyte.
Any metal structure, such as a battery, will have some parasitic inductance and some parasitic capacitance.
These will resonate with each other, something the size of a battery will usually resonate at a few megahertz.
This process is sometimes called "ringing".
However, the electrochemical processes found in batteries have time constants on the order of seconds and will not be affected by megahertz frequencies.
There are some web sites which advertise "battery desulfators" running at megahertz frequencies.
Depending on the size of the battery, the desulfation process can take from 48h to weeks to complete.
During this period the battery is also trickle charged to continue reducing the amount of lead sulfur in solution.
Commercial regenerators often support multiple batteries to provide parallel operation to improve throughput.
Parkenfestivalen is an outdoors festival that takes place in Bodø, Norway every year in August.
This has been a tradition ever since 2006, and the festival only gets bigger every year.
The festival is held in a park called Rensåsparken.
In the beginning the people organizing the festival only expected about 2500 paying visitors, but already the first year many more came.
This year it was sold out about 8 months before it took place.
The target group for the festival is mainly young adults and adults.
Rensåsparken is a park close to the center of Bodø.
During the year the park is a popular place where people have picnics, take walks and just hang out.
This festival has several stages, the main stage, the «park-stage» and the «lairo-stage».
The main stage is the biggest, and it is here you will find the most known artists.
At the «lairo-stage» you will often find different dj´s, this stage is located at the top of the park, here there is fewer people and the atmosphere is more intimate.
At the «park-stage» local artists often perform, some of these are well known among the citizens of Bodø, whilst other might be performing for the first time.
The parkenfestival started in 2006, and has only gotten bigger since that.
The first time the festival had hoped for about 2500 paying guests, but the first day over 5000 showed up, and on the second day 7500.
During the years the artists has become more international, compared to the first years when they had a lot of Norwegian and Scandinavian artists.
Parken Livve is all part of the Park festival which holds concerts several times a year .
Parken Live has hosted several major concerts with famous artists such as Circus Eliassen, Kaizers Orchestra and Karpe Diem .
In 2013, Parken Live arrange concerts with famous artists like Wiz Khalifa, Lissie and Donkeyboy.

Here can you find useful information about the various artists and bands, advertisements of sponsors, and interviews with some of the artists . “Parkenavisa” is published as an appendix in the newspaper “Avisa Nordland” around one month before the Park festival starts.
In the “parkenavisa” of 2013, you can find a lot of stuff, like interviews, the tradition with drink holders, advertisements from the various sponsor and some information about the various artists and bands. “Park festival” is a major event that happened in Bodø.
The newspapers “Avisa Nordland”and “Bodø Nu” are two of the biggest newspapers that write about everything that happens before, during and after the “Park festival”.
They write about artists that are coming, reviews, and other stuff that is related to “Park festival” .
The newspaper “Avisa Nordland” is one of the sponsors of the “Park festival”.
The McMorran and Washburne Department Store Building, also known as the Tiffany Building, is a four-story commercial structure in Eugene, Oregon.
The original two-story building was constructed in 1902 by Nels Roney as a dry goods store owned by former Eugene mayor J. H. McClung.
The building was expanded to four stories in 1913.
John H. McClung arrived in Oregon and began farming in 1856.
With his uncle, he established the first drug store in Eugene in 1859.
In 1902 he built the two-story McClung Building at Eighth and Willamette, operating a dry goods store under the name, Cockerline and Fraley.
The building featured elements of what came to be known as Chicago commercial style, with large display windows and reduced ornamentation.
George H. McMorran and Carl G. Washburne became business partners, opening a dry goods store in 1909.
The two had worked as store clerks for Samuel H. Friendly in Eugene.
In 1913 McMorran and Washburne purchased and renovated the McClung building, adding two floors.
McMorran and Washburne became Eugene's premiere dry goods store, and in 1927 the store outgrew its location and was moved to a new building at the corner of Broadway and Willamette.
When McMorran and Washburne vacated the building, it was purchased by drugstore owners Albert Tiffany and George Davis, and the name was changed to the Tiffany Building.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places March 2, 1989, under the historic name, McMorran and Washburne Department Store Building.
Restaurant and retail businesses occupy the ground floor of the building, and the three upper stories have been converted to apartments.
Bhimakheda is a village near Mehidpur City, India.
It is located in the state of Madhya Pradesh and the district Ujjain.
Coreura alcedo is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae.
It was described by Max Wilhelm Karl Draudt in 1915.
Continuous-scan laser Doppler vibrometry (CSLDV) is a method of using a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) in which the laser beam is swept across the surface of a test subject to capture the motion of a surface at many points simultaneously.
This is different from scanning laser vibrometry (SLDV) in which the laser beam is kept at a fixed point during each measurement and quickly moved to a new position before acquiring the next measurement.
CSLDV can allow one to capture the mode shapes of a structure with high resolution much more quickly than would be possible with SLDV.
Allen & Sracic show results where measurements were acquired with CSLDV in a hundredth of the time that would be required for LDV.
Allen & Aguilar postulated that the additional detail available from CSLDV might provide important information when validating structural dynamic models.
CSLDV also makes testing with an instrumented hammer practical with LDV, and some have speculated that CSLDV might be useful in cases where it is impossible to recreate the input forces, such as explosive loadings.
The primary disadvantage of CSLDV is the additional laser speckle noise that occurs if the laser spot scans the structure too quickly.
Speckle noise is caused by micro-scale irregularities in the surface that change the intensity pattern of the laser light received by the LDV as it scans the surface.
Similar problems arise when applying LDV to rotating shafts, crankshafts for example.
Speckle noise is difficult to predict, depending on the properties of the surface, the geometry of the structure and position of the LDV, so further research is needed to establish the limits of CSLDV.
Sriram et al. seem to have been the first to publish regarding CSLDV, although they studied it for only a few years and discontinued research.
Most of the subsequent advances in this area have arisen from the group at Imperial College in London by Stanbridge, Ewins, Martarelli and Di Maio, who coined the term "CSLDV".
Allen's research group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison began work in this area in 2006 and published the first output-only CSLDV algorithm and extended the Harmonic Transfer Function methodology by Wereley & Hall to CSLDV measurements.
Zhu's research group at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County applied CSLDV to structural damage detection and developed a damage identification methodology for beams that uses demodulation and polynomial methods.
The video in the link below illustrates the process and some of the scan patterns that are possible.
Otto Berchem (born 1967 Milford, Connecticut) is an American artist who lives and works in Bogota.
Otto Berchem’s practice explores social and visual codes, focusing on the relationships between language, architecture, history and poetry.
His conceptual based practice employs a wide variety of media, including painting, video, public interventions and other unconventional artist activities.
Berchem’s interest in codes goes back to 1994’s Men’s Room Etiquette, a public intervention touching upon the unwritten codes of how men behave with other men in public toilets.
With The Dating Market, a project conceived in 2000, Berchem created a series of shopping baskets with a flower motif that patrons of supermarkets could opt for, labeling themselves “available” and looking for a date.
In Temporary Person Passing Through, a work for the 2005 Istanbul Biennial, Berchem investigated the relationship of Istanbul’s street children and their movement within the city, using the visual language of Hobo Signs, a system of symbols employed by itinerant workers in the USA from the 19th to the mid 20th century.
With his recent work the artist continues his exploration of signs, human relationships and codes, to create a chromatic alphabet.
Berchem’s chromatic code is inspired by the writings of Jorge Adoum and Vladimir Nabokov, Peter Saville’s designs for the first three New Order albums, and the condition of Synaesthesia (which Nabokov had).
Through the use of this alphabet, Berchem has proposed a series of work reviewing iconic images and creating his own documents by strategically deleting pre-existing meanings and slogans, and replacing them with his interpretation of reality.
Berchem obtained his BFA from Parsons School of Design in New York City in 1990.
In 1994, he received his MFA from Edinburgh College of Art and in 1995/1996, attended Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten, Amsterdam.
Drazark monastery , a destroyed monastic complex of Armenian Apostolic Church in Adana province of modern Turkey, which lies about 24 km. north of the city of Sis - historical capital of Cilician Armenia, at one of inaccessible slopes of Cilician Taurus range ("middle part of the Taurus Mountains").
Drazark in Armenian language directly means "knock on the door".
But beside Drazark the monastery was known by some other names: Summarizing recollections on Drazark frequently met numerous words like "big, inhabited by angels, notable, extremely outstanding" and similar characterizations which allows to suggest, this was a great monastic complex.
Drazark consisted of 5 churches.
Main church standing in the middle was called Surb Astvatzatzin that in Armenian language means "Holy Virgin".
Another 4 churches were attached to it by forming a cross: The date the monastery was founded is unknown, but the first mention refers to the 10th century AD.
At the start of the 12th century (1100–1129) Prince Toros I restored the monastery, turned it to Cilician Roubenid mausoleum and an educational center.
There was also bishop's residence of the capital Sis.
Construction was headed by persons who came upon the invitation of Prince Toros I.
They were Gevorg Meghrik Vaspurakantsi (George Meghrik from Vaspurakan) and Kirakos Gitnakan (Kirakos the Scientist).
After the request of the prince these persons remained there and in (1050–1121) period they launched an exuberant educational activity, made numerous handwritten books and manuscripts for the monks brotherhood, developed a regulations whereby the monks must be occupied by reading and copying the manuscripts.
They have proofread the "Apostles' Act" after translation from Greek, interpretation of St. John's Gospel , completed a "Celebrating" and "Lunch" books, translated several codexes and testimonies.
At 1114 (after the death of archimandrite Gevorg Meghrik) as a new leader was elected the archimandrite Kirakos Gitnakan.
Years later, the monastery of Drazark headed an archimandrite Barseh - personality endowed with special privileges.
It was followed an archimandrite Samuel (1178–1181).
At the coronation of King Levon II also attended the leader of Drazark monastery archibishop Hovannes which was also archibishop of Sis in 1198–1219 period.
Many notable personalities of the time acted in Drazark monastery, such as Vardan Aygektsi, Arakel Hnazandents, Barseh Gitnavor, Konstantin Lambronatsi at whose time the monastery became target to enemies (1305).
Within the walls of Drazark monastery studied such a masters of medieval written language as Hovhannes Arqayeghbayr (1220–1289)(junior brother of the King Hetum I), Sargis Pitsak and some others.
The monsatery was also famed by its high level of musical education.
Toros P'ilisop'a (the Philosopher) and Hovsep Yerazhisht were the illustrious heads of the monastic musicians.
Drazark monastery had a reputation of high quality of teaching the languages and there always encouraged overall development for its pupils.
Inside of the monastery trained the diplomats for the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.
For example Toros Philosopher was subsequently a statesman of Cilician Armenia.
At the time of Levon 3 (1269–89) and Hetum 2 (1289–1307), Toros Philosopher served as ambassador of Cilician Armenia in kingdom of England.
Monastery of Drazark remained standing even after the demise of Cilician Armenia.
It was functioning even in dark period of the Seljukid and Ottoman rulers for Cilician Armenians in next several centuries.
At the time of Cilician Massacre the monastery were plundered and ceased functioning, as its priests were murdered by Turks.
Eventually the monastery of Drazark ceased to exist during the Armenian Genocide.
It shared the fate of millions Armenians and fell victim to Turks.
Ruins of Drazark monastery, especially its main church of Surb Astvatzatzin were still available up to 1930, but later in all probability they were completely erased by Turks.
However, the Matenadaran institute (repository of ancient Armenian manuscripts) in Yerevan has a collection containing over 40 handwritten books made at Drazark monastery.
They are written partially at a parchment and decorated by miniature paintings done by hands of medieval authors of gilded paint with wide use of Vordan Karmir.
In addition some of the manuscripts that was created in Drazark stored today in Matenadaran institute under the numbers: 154, 199, 1576, 3792, 3845, 3929, 5736, 6290, 10524.
There is a Bibles, interpretations, motet writings, tutorials on natural sciences, the oldest copy of famous "Book of Lamentations" by Grigor Narekatsi and so on.
New Jersey's 20th Legislative District is one of 40 in the New Jersey Legislature.
As of the 2011 apportionment, the district includes the Union County municipalities of Elizabeth City, Hillside Township, Roselle Borough and Union Township.
As of the 2010 United States Census, the district had a population of 210,628, of whom 159,952 (75.9%) were of voting age.
The racial makeup of the district was 111,978 (53.2%) White, 54,600 (25.9%) African American, 1,192 (0.6%) Native American, 9,387 (4.5%) Asian, 46 (0.0%) Pacific Islander, 25,490 (12.1%) from some other race, and 7,898 (3.7%) from two or more races.
Hispanic or Latino of any race were 89,691 (42.6%) of the population.
The district had 119,153 registered voters as of November 30, 2017, of whom 43,491 (36.5%) were registered as unaffiliated, 65,719 (55.2%) were registered as Democrats, 8,986 (7.5%) were registered as Republicans, and 957 (0.8%) were registered to other parties.
The district has a higher-than-average percentage of residents who are foreign born (at 35.6%, the 3rd highest of all 40 districts in the state), Hispanic (5th highest of any district statewide) and African American (11th highest).
The number and percentage of registered voters is lowest in the state.
Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by a better than 4 to 1 margin, with Republican registration percentage one of the lowest of any district statewide.
When the 40-district legislative map was created in 1973, the 20th was a central Union County-based district including Westfield, Garwood, Cranford, Roselle, Roselle Park, Union Township, and Hillside Township.
In the 1981 redistricting, the 20th District received completely new municipalities in eastern Union County including Elizabeth, Linden, Rahway, and Carteret in Middlesex County, New Jersey.
Carteret was removed from the district following the 1991 redistricting but Roselle was added from the 21st District.
Changes to the district made as part of the New Jersey Legislative redistricting in 2001, based on the results of the 2000 United States Census removed Linden and Rahway (both to the 22nd Legislative District) and added Kenilworth and Union Township (both from the 21st District).
As part of the 2011 apportionment, Hillside was added from the 29th District, while Kenilworth Borough was shifted to the 21st District.
The district is represented for the 2018–2019 Legislative Session (Senate, General Assembly) in the State Senate by Joseph Cryan (D, Union Township) and in the General Assembly by Annette Quijano (D, Elizabeth) and Jamel Holley (D, Roselle).
In the 1973 State Senate race, Alexander J. Menza defeated incumbent Republican Frank X. McDermott, who had served 10 years in office, helping the Democrats gain control of the state legislature for only the third time in the 20th century.
In the 1975 elections, McDermott made a comeback and won a seat in the Assembly.
In the 1977 Senate race, Menza chose not to run for re-election (he would run a distant third in the 1978 United States Senate primaries).
McDermott ran again for the seat, losing to Democrat Anthony E. Russo.
In redistricting following the 1980 United States Census, C. Louis Bassano was shifted to the 21st Legislative District, where he ran for (and won) the State Senate seat.
Chuck Hardwick was also shifted to the 21st District, where he would win the Assembly seat.
With both seats open, Democrats Thomas J. Deverin and Raymond Lesniak, who had both previously served as representatives of the 21st District, won in the Assembly.
In the Senate race that year, Anthony E. Russo was also shifted to the 21st District and was replaced by John T. Gregorio, an incumbent Democrat who was shifted from the 21st District.
Gregorio was forced to resign in 1983 after being convicted of conspiracy for concealing his ownership of two go-go bars that were operated by his son.
In a June 1983 special election, Lesniak won the seat Gregorio was forced to vacate.
In turn, another special election was held in August 1983 to fill Lesniak's vacancy, a race that was won by Thomas W. Long.
After five terms in the 20th District, Thomas J. Deverin was relocated to the 19th Legislative District in 1991, with redistricting following the 1990 Census tending to favor Republicans.
In the 1991 Republican landslide, the 20th bucked the trend, with incumbent George Hudak and Elizabeth Mayor Thomas G. Dunn narrowly holding on to the seats for the Democrats.
Hudak and Dunn did not run for re-election in 1993.
In the 1993 election, two former Union County Freeholders, Joseph Suliga and Neil M. Cohen (the latter also served in the Assembly from 1990 to 1992 from the 21st District) were elected.
Suliga represented the district in the Assembly until 2002, when he was shifted to the 22nd Legislative District as part of the 2001 redistricting, and was elected to the State Senate.Joseph Cryan was elected to the Assembly in 2001, filling Suliga's Assembly seat.
Cohen resigned from the Assembly on July 24, 2008, after images of child pornography were found on his state-issued computer.
Democratic committee members from the district selected Annette Quijano to fill Cohen's vacancy.
Joseph Cryan stepped down on January 4, 2015 to become Union County Sheriff.
The Union County Democrats selected Roselle Mayor Jamel Holley as his replacement on January 21, 2015.
Senators and Assembly members elected from the district are as follows:
Desmond M. O'Grady is an Australian journalist, author, and playwright who has resided and worked in Rome since 1962.
Desmond Michael O’Grady, (b. 11 December 1929) was born in Melbourne Australia, the son of Edward O'Grady and Winifred (Kiernan) O'Grady.
He had an elder brother, Lance.
In 1936 he attended elementary school at the Good Shepherd Convent Melbourne.
His father worked for the Australian Navy, and from 1940 he attendted the Marist Brothers (Sydney) where his father was transferred to take charge of the naval stores at Garden Island Naval Base there.
He returned to complete elementary school at the Christian Brothers (often called in the USA the Irish Christian Brothers to distinguish them from the De La Salle Brothers, also called Christian Brothers) in St. Kilda, Melbourne where he finished his secondary education.
As a boy, O'Grady played cricket with the South Melbourne club in Melbourne and in his youth as an opening batsman for the Italian national team.
He has won amateur tennis tournaments both in singles and doubles and as an Australian schoolboy was a champion middle distance runner.
In 1950 he began his studies with the Arts Faculty at the University of Melbourne, where he graduated in 1953.
He taught English Literature and History at the secondary level in Victoria until he sailed for Europe in 1955.
Mr. O'Grady took his diploma in Italian from the University for Foreigners in Perugia, Italy.
Upon taking his diploma in Italian, he worked in Rome for the US Catholic Immigration Office interviewing refugees from Eastern Europe.
Mr. O'Grady previously had short stories and articles published and a play of his staged in Melbourne when, in 1957, he started working as a journalist in Sydney.
In 1957 he married a Roman, Giuseppina Culotta, and with her returned to Melbourne where he worked for a time in the Australian Immigration Department.
His first child, Kieran Gregory O'Grady, was born in Melbourne in 1958.
His second child, Donatella O'Grady, was born in Rome in 1964 after he had again returned to that city.
While in Australia, became foreign editor and then literary editor of the renowned weekly magazine The Bulletin but, in 1962, for family reasons, returned to Rome.
Since that time, he has lived in Rome as a journalist and author of books.
Although a Catholic he had not written about religion in Australia but upon returning to Rome he saw the Vatican Council, which began in 1962 which presented itself as an important journalistic opportunity.
He wrote about the Council for publications world-wide becoming also the first Vatican correspondent for the USA's "National Catholic Reporter" when it was founded.
Time (19 November 1965) described his coverage of the Council as "consistently discerning in conveying (its) moods and trends".
He covered Vatican affairs for The National Catholic Reporter, The Washington Post, for Our Sunday Visitor and for the English Tablet.
He has for his entire career also written about Italian affairs ranging from politics to culture and travel, mainly for the "Sydney Morning Herald" and the "Melbourne Age" and other publications (see Bibliography, below).
He has written 14 published books of fiction and non-fiction, including novels, collections of short stories, history and biography; many of these have been translated into various languages.
Currently, Mr. O'Grady writes from Italy for "The Sydney Morning Herald", "The Australian" and "The Age of Melbourne" and other publications.
United Nations Security Council resolution 1515, adopted unanimously on 19 November 2003, after recalling all previous resolutions on the situation in the Middle East, particularly resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002) and the Madrid Principles, the Council endorsed the Road map for peace proposed by the Middle East Quartet in an attempt to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.
The resolution, proposed by Russia, envisaged a Palestinian state by 2005 in return for security guarantees for Israel.
The Security Council expressed concern at the continuing violence in the Middle East, reiterating its demand for an end to hostilities and all acts of terrorism, provocation, incitement and destruction.
It envisaged a solution whereby Israel and Palestine exist side by side within recognised borders and solutions to the Israeli–Lebanese and Israeli–Syrian situations.
Welcoming international diplomatic efforts, the resolution called on all parties to fulfil their obligations under the Road map working in co-operation with the Quartet in order to achieve a two-state solution.

"The Woman in You" is one of five songs the Bee Gees contributed to the film, "Staying Alive", the sequel to "Saturday Night Fever".
Director Sylvester Stallone used the Bee Gees songs in the movie more as background music rather than the prominent way "Saturday Night Fever" had featured them.
The single received more airplay than the Bee Gees previous two singles, though not enough to reach a top 10 position.
In interviews following the release of the film, the brothers expressed their displeasure at the way their songs were edited and revealed that their hearts were not in the music.
By 1983, the Bee Gees were focusing their talents on solo projects and production of other artists, so it is not surprising that they were not all enthusiastic about the "Staying Alive" movie. "The Woman in You" was the last track recorded for "Staying Alive", and the lead single from the soundtrack.
The video, directed by Brian Grant and conceptualised by Keith Williams, which did air in rotation on MTV, featured each brother in a working class job where they all come in contact with the same woman (Cynthia Rhodes) who lures them away.

The Archdiocese of Huambo is a Latin Metropolitan archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church in western Angola.
The cathedral see of the archbishop is the Marian Cathedral of the Conception of Our Lady (Sé Catedral de Nossa Senhora da Conceição), in Huambo.
By 2013, the archdiocese had approximately 1.5 million Roman Catholics and 75 diocesan priests.
On 9 September 1940, the Diocese of Nova Lisboa was established on assembled territories split off from the Diocese of São Paulo de Loanda and mission sui iuris of Cunene, mainly to serve the growing European population in what was then the colony of Portuguese Angola.
As time went on, it shed territory due to the creation of other dioceses : On 3 February 1977, the Diocese of Nova Lisboa was promoted and renamed the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Huambo.

The United States Army Special Operations Command (Airborne) (USASOC) is the command charged with overseeing the various special operations forces of the United States Army.
Headquartered at Fort Bragg, NC, it is the largest component of the United States Special Operations Command.
Its mission is to organize, train, educate, man, equip, fund, administer, mobilize, deploy and sustain Army special operations forces to successfully conduct worldwide special operations.
Established in 1952, the U.S. Army Special Forces Command (Airborne), also known as the Green Berets, was established as a special operations force of the United States Army tasked with five primary missions: unconventional warfare, foreign internal defense, special reconnaissance, direct action, and counter-terrorism.
These missions make special forces unique in the U.S. military, because they are employed throughout the three stages of the operational continuum: peacetime, conflict and war.
Today's Special Forces Groups and their unconventional warfare capabilities provide a viable military option for a variety of operational taskings that are inappropriate or infeasible for conventional forces, making it the U.S. military’s premier unconventional warfare force.
Often SF units are required to perform additional, or collateral, activities outside their primary missions.
These collateral activities are coalition warfare/support, combat search and rescue, security assistance, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, humanitarian de-mining and counter-drug operations.
In 2016, the 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) manages seven special forces groups (SFGs) (five active duty and two national guard), two military information support groups (MISG), one civil affairs brigade, one sustainment brigade, and has an organic military intelligence battalion.
The mission of the 4th and 8th Psychological Operations Groups (POGs) Psychological Operations (PSYOP) units is to provide fully capable strategic influence forces to Combatant Commanders, U.S.
Ambassadors, and other agencies to synchronize plans and execute inform and influence activities (IIA) across the range of military operations.
Psychological Operations is a part of the broad range of U.S. political, military, economic and ideological activities used by the U.S. government to secure national objectives.
Used during peacetime, contingencies and declared war these activities are not forms of force, but are force multipliers that use nonviolent means in often violent environments.
Persuading rather than compelling physically, they rely on logic, fear, desire or other mental factors to promote specific emotions, attitudes or behaviors.
The ultimate objective of U.S. PSYOP is to convince enemy, neutral, and friendly nations and forces to take action favorable to the United States and its allies.
The ranks of the PSYOP include regional experts and linguists who understand political, cultural, ethnic and religious subtleties and use persuasion to influence perceptions and encourage desired behavior.
With functional experts in all aspects of tactical communications, PSYOP offers joint force commanders unmatched abilities to influence target audiences as well as strategic influence capabilities to U.S. diplomacy.
In addition to supporting commanders, PSYOP units provide interagency strategic influence capabilities to other U.S. government agencies.
In operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to drug interdiction, PSYOP enhances the impact of those agencies’ actions.
Their activities can be used to spread information about ongoing programs and to gain support from the local populace.
The 95th Civil Affairs Brigade (Airborne) enable military commanders and U.S.
Ambassadors to improve relationships with various stakeholders in a local area to meet the objectives of the U.S. government. 95th Civil Affairs Brigade (Airborne) teams work with U.S. Department of State country teams, government and nongovernmental organizations at all levels and with local populations in peaceful, contingency and hostile environments.
95th Civil Affairs Brigade (Airborne) units can rapidly deploy to remote areas with small villages, as well as to larger population centers around the world.
They help host nations assess the needs of an area, bring together local and non-local resources to ensure long-term stability, and ultimately degrade and defeat violent extremist organizations and their ideologies.
They may be involved in disaster prevention, management, and recovery, and with human and civil infrastructure assistance programs. 95th Civil Affairs Brigade (Airborne) soldiers are soldiers first, but are adept at working in foreign environments and conversing in one of about 20 foreign languages with local stakeholders.
Brigade teams may work for months or years in remote areas of a host nation.
Their low profile and command structure allow them to solidify key relationships and processes, to address root causes of instability that adversely affect the strategic interests of the United States.
The 528th Sustainment Brigade (Airborne) is responsible for providing logistical, medical and signal support for Army special operations forces worldwide in support of contingency missions and war fighting commanders.
Headquartered at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the 528th Sustainment Brigade (Airborne) sets the operational level logistics conditions to enable Army Special Operation Forces (ARSOF) operations worldwide using three ARSOF Support Operations Teams (ASPOs), three Special Operations Resuscitation Teams (SORT), five ARSOF Liaison Elements (ALE), two Medical Level II teams and 112th Special Operations Signal Battalion (Airborne).
Together the units of the brigade ensure that U.S. Army Special Operations Forces are equipped to perform their missions.
The brigade has the capability of providing technical control to multiple Special Forces group support battalions in the planning and execution of ARSOF combat service support and combat health support.
The 528th Sustainment Brigade (Airborne) is capable of deploying three Army Support Operations Teams in support of three ARSOF-based Special Operations Task Forces or a SOF-based JTF.
The Support Operations Team initially co-locates with the group support battalion or a Ranger support operations detachment and provides ARSOF with an in-theater presence providing centralized and integrated material management of property, equipment maintenance, logistical automation and repair parts and supplies.
ARSOF Liaison Elements soldiers are embedded in Army regional theaters’ staff.
They plan and coordinate with theater Army, Special Operations Command and Army Special Operations Command to ensure support during operations and training.
As a theater Army staff member, these officers and non-commissioned officers’ knowledge of theater-specific requirements and capabilities assist units in coordination with the theater.
The medical section provides Level II medical support as USASOC asset managed by the brigade surgeon and constitutes the nucleus of the capability of receiving a conventional Army Forward Surgical Team.
The medical section is robust enough to provide combat health support on an area basis for approximately 450 personnel.
The support includes unit-level medical support and health services, logistics, emergency medical and resuscitative treatment for all classes of patients; emergency dental treatment, physical therapy and preventive medicine support, while maintaining Standard Army Management Information Systems and providing veterinary support.
Members of the 112th Special Operations Signal Battalion (Airborne) specialize in communication and force sustainment skills, employing innovative telecommunications technologies to provide Army Special Operations Task Force commanders with secure and nonsecure voice, data and video services.
In their respective fields, signal and support soldiers provide oversight of material distribution management, synchronization, and integrated material management of property accountability, maintenance management and logistics automation for deployed ARSOF.
Communications expertise allows ARSOF to "shoot, move and communicate" on a continuous basis.
Soldiers assigned to ARSOF units are taught to operate and maintain a vast array of unique equipment not normally used by their conventional counterparts.
To meet the needs of ARSOF, the Sustainment Brigade has developed logistical and signal packages that are rapidly deployable on a moment’s notice.
Soldiers assigned to these units are airborne qualified.
The 528th Sustainment Brigade embodies its motto of "We Support to the Utmost," providing the means to effectively and efficiently execute logistics in support of ARSOF operations.
The U.S. Army Special Operations Aviation Command (USASOAC), activated on 25 March 2011, organizes, mans, trains, resources and equips Army special operations aviation units to provide responsive, special operations aviation support to Special Operations Forces (SOF) and is the USASOC aviation staff proponent.
Today, USASOAC consists of five distinct units: the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne), the USASOC Flight Company (UFC), the Special Operations Training Battalion (SOATB), the Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO), and the Systems Integration Management Office (SIMO).
The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne), newly subordinate to ARSOAC, provides aviation support to special operations forces.
Known as "Night Stalkers," these soldiers are recognized for their proficiency in nighttime operations striking undetected during the hours of darkness and are recognized as the pioneers of the US Army’s nighttime flying techniques.
Today, Night Stalkers continue to develop and employ new technology and tactics, techniques and procedures for the battlefield.
They employ highly modified Chinook, Black Hawk and assault and attack configurations of Little Bird helicopters.
The 160th SOAR(A) is composed of a regiment headquarters, four battalions and a dedicated training company.
The regiment headquarters is collocated with the 1st and 2nd Battalions and the Special Operations Aviation Training Company at Fort Campbell, Kentucky; 3rd Battalion is located at Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia; and 4th Battalion is located at Fort Lewis, Washington.
This strategic organizational structure postures the regiment to support special operations forces mission and training requirements well into the future.
The 75th Ranger Regiment, also known as the Rangers, is an airborne light-infantry special operations unit.
The regiment is headquartered at Fort Benning, Georgia and is composed of one airborne special troops battalion (BN) and three airborne light-infantry BNs; two of those BNs (the 1st and 2nd) are stationed at Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia and Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington respectively.
Within the US special operations community, the 75th Ranger Regiment is unique with its ability to attack heavily defended targets of interest.
The regiment specializes in air assault, direct action raids, seizure of key terrain (such as airfields), destroying strategic facilities, and capturing or killing high-profile individuals.
Each BN of the regiment can deploy anywhere in the world within 18 hours notice.
Rangers are capable of conducting squad through regimental size operations using a variety of insertion techniques including airborne, air assault, and ground infiltration.
The regiment is an all-volunteer force with an intensive screening and selection process followed by combat-focused training.
Rangers are resourced to maintain exceptional proficiency, experience and readiness.
The U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (SWCS) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, is one of the Army's premier education institutions, managing and resourcing professional growth for soldiers in the Army's three distinct special-operations branches: Special Forces, Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations.
The soldiers educated through SWCS programs are using cultural expertise and unconventional techniques to serve their country in far-flung areas across the globe.
More than anything, these soldiers bring integrity, adaptability and regional expertise to their assignments.
On any given day, approximately 3,100 students are enrolled in SWCS training programs.
Courses range from entry-level training to advanced warfighter skills for seasoned officers and NCOs.
The 1st Special Warfare Training Group (Airborne) qualifies soldiers to enter the special-operations community, and teaches them advanced tactical skills as they progress through their careers.
The Joint Special Operations Medical Training Center, operating under the auspices of the Special Warfare Medical Group, is the central training facility for Department of Defense special-operations combat medics.
Furthermore, SWCS leads efforts to professionalize the Army's entire special-operations force through the Special Forces Warrant Officer Institute and the David K. Thuma Noncommissioned Officer Academy.
While most courses are conducted at Fort Bragg, SWCS enhances its training by maintaining facilities, and relationships with outside institutions, across the country.
The 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (1st SFOD-D), commonly referred to as Delta Force, Combat Applications Group/"CAG", "The Unit", Army Compartmented Element, or within JSOC as Task Force Green, is an elite Special Mission Unit of the United States Army, under the organization of the USASOC but is controlled by the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC).
It is used for hostage rescue and counterterrorism, as well as direct action and reconnaissance against high-value targets. 1st SFOD-D and its U.S. Navy counterpart, DEVGRU, "SEAL Team 6", perform many of the most highly complex and dangerous missions in the U.S. military.
These units are also often referred to as "Tier One" and special mission units by the U.S. government.
Łukasz Waldemar Gąsior (born January 14, 1986) is a Polish swimmer, who specialized in middle-distance freestyle events.
He represented his nation Poland at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and has won a career total of three medals (two golds and one bronze) in a major international competition, spanning the 2004 European Junior Swimming Championships in Lisbon, Portugal.
Gasior competed for the Polish squad in two swimming events at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.
He raced to a sixth-seeded time in 1:48.52 coming to the top-eight final to dip beneath the FINA B-standard (1:48.72) by two tenths of a second (0.2) at the European Championships five months earlier in Eindhoven, Netherlands.
In the 200 m freestyle, Gasior rounded out the field to eighth in the last of eight heats with a frustrating 1:49.25, trailing eventual Olympic champion Michael Phelps of the United States and runner-up Park Tae-hwan of South by nearly four seconds, and missing the semifinals with a thirty-fourth place finish from the prelims.
Gasior also teamed up with Łukasz Wójt, Michał Rokicki, and Przemysław Stańczyk in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay.
Swimming the lead-off leg, Gasior recorded a split of 1:48.40, and the Polish team went on to finish heat two in seventh place and fourteenth overall with a final time of 7:18.09.
Alfred Landon Rives (born in March 25, 1830, Paris, France - February 27, 1903 Castle Hill, Virginia) was an American engineer.
Alfred Rives was the son of William Cabell and Judith (Walker) Rives.
His father, who was among the most distinguished citizens of Virginia, was the United States minister to France, and he also filled the same position in 1848.
Rives was taught by private tutors until fourteen years of age, then became a student of Concord Academy.
At the age of sixteen he entered the Virginia Military Institute, and graduated in two years, ranking sixth in a class of twenty-four.
Being proficient in engineering, he determined to adopt that as a profession, and in 1848 entered the University of Virginia, where he remained one session, then accompanied his father to France.
After a year devoted to the study of mathematics and French, he successfully passed an examination for entrance in the Government Engineering School of France, "Ecole des ponts et Chaussees."
After graduation in 1854, he was offered a position upon the great French railroad, "Du Nord," but instead returned to the United States, where he served in the engineering corps of the Virginia Midland railway.
Later Rives accepted a position in Washington under Captain Montgomery C. Meigs of the United States Engineering Corps.
He served for a year as assistant engineer of the United States Capitol and Post Office buildings.
He was appointed Secretary of the Interior under President Pierce, to report upon the best location for a bridge across the Potomac.
He presented details and estimates for the project in the 1857 "Congressional records".
The report was favorably received, and Rives was selected to make calculations and estimates for this Cabin John bridge, which was built under his supervision.
He returned to Virginia, his native state, upon its secession from the Union.
Three days later he received the commission of captain of engineers from the state of Virginia, and was directed to report to Colonel Andrew Talcott, at that time chief engineer of the state.
Rives was assigned to duty on the lower Virginia peninsula, and upon the resignation of Colonel Talcott was soon made acting chief engineer of the state of Virginia.
Later, Rives was appointed acting chief of the Engineer Bureau of the Confederate States, a position he held until the close of the Civil War.
He was promoted successively to be major, lieutenant-colonel and colonel of engineers.
After the war he was offered a professorship in several institutions of learning, and also a good architectural position under the United States government, all of which he declined, preferring to try to recover his fortunes in Richmond as an engineer and architect.
In 1868 was division engineer of the Chesapeake & Ohio railroad.
In 1870 he was appointed chief engineer of the Mobile & Birmingham railroad.
He was engineer in charge of the South & North Alabama railroad and part of the Louisville & Nashville system, which he completed in 1873.
He was offered by Gen. William T. Sherman, for the Khedive of Egypt, the position of chief engineer of the civil works of Egypt, which position he declined to accept and of chief engineer and general superintendent of the Mobile & Ohio railroad.
In 1883, Rives became vice-president and general manager of the Richmond and Danville Railroad, now a part of the Southern railway System.
In 1886, was appointed a member of the United States commissioned to inspect and receive on the part of the government forty miles of the Northern Pacific Railroad in the state of Washington, and the following year became general superintendent of the Panama Railroad, and while with that railroad went to Paris, and concluded a traffic agreement with the Canal Company.
He presented to the canal commission a plan for the completion of the Panama Canal, in which he had always taken a great interest.
In 1894, he communicated to the director of the canal a plan for the construction of a part at La Boca in the vicinity of Panama, which if constructed would tend greatly to facilitate and increase the traffic across the isthmus.
After resigning his position with the Panama railroad, he was made chief engineer of the Cape Cod Canal.
He was also elected vice president, and was specially charged with the construction of the Vera Cruz & Pacific railroad in Mexico.
He died at Castle Hill, February 27, 1903.
His papers are held at Duke University.
Rives married Sadie MacMurdo, with whom he had three children: Amelia, who became a well-known author and wife of Prince Trubetskoy; Gertrude, the wife of Allen Potts, Esq. ; and Miss Landon Rives.
George Grantham (also George W. Grantham) (born May 11, 1941) is an American economic historian and Emeritus Professor at McGill University.
His contribution to economics has focused mainly on the agricultural development, particularly of the French rural economy in the 18th and 19th centuries.
For many years before his retirement in 2009, he was a prominent teacher of economics at McGill University and in 2000 he was awarded the Cliometric Society's annual prize – the Clio Can for exceptional support to the field of cliometrics.

The New Worker is the weekly newspaper produced by the New Communist Party of Britain (NCP).
Its first edition came out a few weeks after the NCP was founded in July 1977.
For the first two years the paper was commercially printed but in 1979 production became entirely in-house with the purchase of an off-set litho press.
Individual regular supporters of the "New Worker" in Britain and overseas who want to show greater support for the "New Worker" but are members of other parties or none can join the "New Worker" Supporters Group.
The Barrett XM109 is a prototype anti-materiel rifle, chambered for 25 × 59 mm grenade rounds and developed by Barrett Firearms Manufacturing.
It was designed in accordance with a requirement set out in 1994, and is capable of defeating light armor and equipment out to .
Prototypes of the XM109 have existed since the late 1990s and studies of the weapon's effectiveness were released in 2002; 10 prototypes were known to exist in 2004, and the XM109 and Barrett XM500 were folded into a broader Anti-Material Rifle Congressional Program in 2006.
The current status of the XM109 is not particularly clear, with no news of either cancellation or potential adoption.
The XM109, originally known as the Objective Sniper Weapon (OSW) and now called the Anti-Materiel Payload Rifle (AMPR), is a semi-automatic anti-materiel rifle, designed primarily for engagement of light armored vehicles and similar targets.
The design uses the lower receiver from an M82/M107, but with a new upper receiver chambered in 25mm.
The upper receiver of the M82 rifles can be replaced with an XM109 upper receiver to form a fully functional XM109 rifle.
The 25 × 59 mm round that is used in the XM109 is the same one originally developed for the cancelled XM307, product of the Objective (later Advanced) Crew Served Weapon program (OCSW / ACSW).
As with the XM307, the XM109 can be reconfigured back to .50 BMG, in the XM109's case this is done by swapping the 25mm upper receiver for a standard M82 / M107 upper.
The XM109 offers greater range and a shorter overall length than the previous M82/M107 systems, as well as potentially greater power in the 25 × 59 mm cartridge over even the Mk 211 .50 BMG cartridge (AKA "Raufoss round").
However, the small amount of propellant and heavy projectile resulted in unacceptably high recoil due to limiting the effects of the weapon's muzzle brake, with a recoil force of over 60 foot-pounds compared to 36 for the M107.
As of 2004, one of the project goals was to reduce the weapon's recoil.

The family Prophalangopsidae (formerly known sometimes as Haglidae and the only extant taxon in the superfamily Hagloidea) are insects belonging to the order Orthoptera.
There is only one extant genus in North America, where they are known as grigs, four genera in Asia, and at many extinct genera (see below).
The closest living relatives to the Prophalangopsidae are the family Tettigoniidae (katydids or bush-crickets), but the evolutionary split occurred more than 230 million years ago in the Permian.
The female of the species consumes the wings of the male during mating.

The Separate Problem is a 1979 book by Judy Jolley Mohraz.
It is a collection of case studies of Black education in the Northern United States from 1900-1930.
The book received mixed reviews by critics in academic journals.
Leonard L. Hayes III, the director of the Desegregation Policy Studies Unit of the Institute for Services to Education remarked that “"The Separate Problem" is an excellent source for those persons in search of additional documentation of the efforts put forth by the North to deny blacks access to educational opportunities during the early part of the twentieth century."
Hayes III added that "the author’s effective use of the case study methodology is laudable….although she did not make sufficient use of the rich vein of oral historical tools…” He found the writing style to be “lucid” and well organized except for interchangeably using the terms “Negro,” “black,” and “Black."
Diane Ravitch wrote that the book is flawed due to the author's ideological framework and suggests that the problems in the book may have been "mitigated" through the use of interviews with members of the African-American community.
Ronald D. Cohen of the "Indiana Magazine of History" wrote that the book "heavily influenced by recent revisionist interpretations."
He added that the book is helpful but lacks detail.
Cohen finds that the book relies on newspapers and public documents in such a way that the details of segregation are generalized.
He concludes his review, stating that despite its flaws, the book is "important."
Robert G. Sherer from The American Historical Review finds that “both her [Mohraz] end and her means present theoretical and organizational problems.”

Appointments were made by Premier Mike Rann under Theme 8 of the PACE (Program for Accelerated Exploration) initiative, with the aim of addressing historical perceptions of South Australia's poor mineral and petroleum prospectivity.
Appointed members include high-profile national and international leaders in the resource sector.
SAMPEG promotes the message that South Australia’s resources potential is under-explored and that the State Government "is willing to back investors in the resources sector, in a strategic, tangible and substantial way, including subsidised drilling and new, free, pre-competitive data."
SAMPEG members also address public perception of the sector by informing the public of improving performance in environmental management, good governance and engagement with local and indigenous communities.
This group replaced the original PACE proposal to appoint a single Ambassador.
The group currently includes 16 members.
As of 2014, SAMPEG membership includes the following persons: The original Chair of SAMPEG was Robert J Champion de Crespigny AC.
This position was passed to Ian Gould following de Crespigny's relocation to the United Kingdom in 2006.

During the 2003–04 English football season, Leicester City competed in the FA Premier League.
Micky Adams had guided Leicester back to the Premiership at the first attempt, despite the club spending part of their Division One campaign in receivership before a takeover safeguarded their future.
But he was unable to keep them there, and their relegation was confirmed at the beginning of May.
A 4-0 thumping of fellow relegation rivals Leeds United in September appeared to have set the tone for the rest of the season but it was soon followed by a setback of five straight defeats despite promising displays.
A run of three wins in five games in November kept Leicester in close contention of survival, with the 2-0 victory at Portsmouth seeing them rise to as high as 12th; however, it all went wrong as, after a creditable 1-1 draw with eventual champions Arsenal, the team went into freefall and endured a dreadful run of only one win in 22 games (though most scorelines were reasonably close and they dropped too many points from 12 games they drew which they could have won).
Ultimately, Leicester were relegated in a 2-2 draw at Charlton Athletic, which left them eight points adrift of Manchester City with two games remaining.
It was a traumatic end to a season which had seen the club plagued with crises on and off the field, including the La Manga controversy when players Keith Gillespie, Frank Sinclair and Paul Dickov were accused of sexual assault following an alleged incident at a hotel in Spain (all charges were finally dropped).

Artur Pawlowski is a Polish-Canadian advocate for the homeless and political activist.
Pawlowski was born on March 28, 1973 in Kożuchów, Poland.
Currently he is a street preacher in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
He operates a Christian street outreach organization called Street Church.
Pawlowski is also said to advocate anti-LGBT, anti-abortion, and anti-Muslim positions.
He has spent much time in court due to charges laid against him by the Calgary Police Department.
In 2014, Pawlowski was fined for attempting to participate in the Calgary Stampede parade with his followers without official permission.
On October 24, 2013 he was covered by the National Post stating that Calgary officials have a vendetta and was said to have pulled out a "thick sheaf of white papers from his briefcase" demonstrating the fact that he has had a lengthy battle for his rights to care for the homeless.
In 2000, his first son Nathaniel was still born with a smashed lung and his heart on the opposite side.
Through the doctors' efforts, the child was revived, but the diagnoses were that his son would not survive.
The boy defied all odds and was totally healed.
This incident was best told by the doctors themselves.
After the symposium of doctors, he was told that "Your son should not live but he is alive.
He should not breathe, but he is breathing.
We called your son 'star baby' because he was like a baby that came to us from the stars."
These incidents changed Artur, and lead him to make a commitment to stop living just for himself and start living for God.
In 2005 when the crisis of homelessness reached its climax and headlines were saying "Homeless Lost Hope," "Homelessness on the Rise," "Tent Cities Emerging in Calgary," and "People Dying Under Bridges," Artur decided to walk away from his business realm and to never return.
Within a few years, he went from a small unknown ministry to an organization that was operating from seven locations in Calgary, producing a T.V show that broadcasts to 120 million satellite dishes, distributing hundreds of thousands of meals per year, and starting similar ministries in several different countries.
He became instrumental in reinstating the March for Jesus in different countries including Canada.
Through the years he managed to form a number of policies that were implemented by the government to improve the lives of the poor in Canada.
His advocacy work was recognized many times by the media such as The National Post, who called him the "symbol of free speech."
As well, there were documentaries broadcast in Poland about his work as a "Street Advocate."
For his public preaching and ministering, he has faced constant harassment and persecution.
He was first arrested for publicly reading from the Bible in a Calgary park in 2006, and since then has been arrested or had to turn himself into the authorities ten times.
Street Church Ministries has received over 150 tickets and summons relating to the work of feeding and caring for the homeless with fines ranging from 36 to 10 000 dollars.
Through years for defending the rights of Canadians, he has spent hundreds of thousands of his own money and has remortgaged his home five times.
The ministry has received fines for illegal public gatherings, the giving away of free goods and services, illegal prayer, placement of material such as tables and food on the ground, preaching, making someone uncomfortable, and having illegal signage such as "Jesus is King" etc.
In the face of these trials, Artur has taken the opportunity to testify before lawyers, judges, politicians, and citizens about the greatness of the Living God.
The stories of persecution and arrests were covered many times by international media outlets giving him the opportunity to preach the gospel across the world.
For his commitment to his faith and beliefs, Artur has been recognized by various groups.
In 2012, for his support of Israel, he received the Honorary Chaplain Position for the Province of Alberta from the prestigious Israeli humanitarian organization The Magen David Adom.
He is the first ever to hold such a position for the province of Alberta.
As well, on April 28, 2012, he received the 'Free Speech Award' for his seven years of ongoing defense of Canadian constitutional rights and freedoms.
This award came from the organization called (PGIB) The Progressive Group for Independent Business of which Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is a member.
Artur Pawlowski currently lives in Calgary, Alberta Canada with his wife Marzena and their three children; Nathaniel, Gabriel, Maya- Grace.
He continues his work on the streets with Street Church Ministries and is currently facing four trials for his stand in defending human rights.
From that time, he began charity work with the homeless on the streets of Calgary while continuing with his businesses.

As Elliot Stabler and Olivia Benson investigate standard cases of horrific depravity and cruelty, they gradually find themselves enmeshed in a mysterious situation involving alien abductions, ghosts with bells for eyes, and—perhaps most disturbingly—the appearance of Abler and Henson, two doppelgängers who are living Stabler and Benson's lives better than Stabler and Benson are. "The Huffington Post" included it on a list of "the 10 Best Short Stories You've Never Read", describing it as "funny, disturbing, canny, and inventive", and "engaging, strange, and wholly original."
At "National Public Radio", K. Tempest Bradford compared it to "Lovecraft meets Dick Wolf", stating that it is her "favorite" of Machado's work, while "Strange Horizons" called it a "highlight of the year".

He finished school and received a bachelor's degree in Finance.
When he was 17 his father died suddenly of cancer and Schwartz began playing poker as a distraction.
At first he played a weekly game with friends and family but then moved to online poker.
He financed his PartyPoker account with a credit card and a student loan for $25,000.
Early on his earnings and losses were volatile.

Stratton Park, first called Cheyenne Park, was a Colorado Springs, Colorado park developed by Winfield Scott Stratton to serve local residents and tourists, particularly those who traveled the Colorado Springs and Interurban Railway street cars to Cheyenne canyon.
Attractions on the line included Seven Falls, The Broadmoor and Cheyenne Mountain Zoo.
Stratton, president of the railroad, bought the land in 1900 and donated 20 acres for the park he named Cheyenne Park.
He oversaw the construction of bridges, rock walls for Cheyenne Creek, and footpaths along what had been land of hills, wildflowers, and wildlife.
It was from the end of the Cheyenne Canyon line.
Construction was completed for a bandstand and a building of refreshment stands and waiting rooms.
The park was dedicated on June 6, 1901, during which John Philip Sousa and his band played for 4,000 attendees.
When the park was completed in 1902 it had ponds for swimming and fishing, gardens, and picnic pavilions.
Other recreational facilities included a baseball field, a shuffleboard court, rides for children and adults, and a dance pavilion.
After Stratton died in 1902, it was named Stratton Park.
Up to 10,000 people visited the park during the summer weekends.
On Sundays in the summer, the Colorado Midway Band played for the audience at the bandstand.
In 1932 part of the park was sold to Pierce Hampe for real estate development and ten acres was sold for the construction of the Colorado P.E.O.

John Claiborn Mayberry (born February 18, 1949) is a former Major League Baseball player who was active from 1968 to 1982 for the Houston Astros, Kansas City Royals, Toronto Blue Jays and New York Yankees.
He was a two-time All Star.
Mayberry attended Northwestern High School, graduating in 1967.
He was a gifted high school athlete, playing baseball, football, and basketball at Northwestern; John was twice named to the Detroit News All-State Basketball Team.
After graduation, Mayberry was selected by the Houston Astros in the first round (sixth overall) of the 1967 Major League Baseball draft.
He was the second first baseman taken in the draft, Ron Blomberg having been selected number one overall by the New York Yankees.
As an 18-year-old, Mayberry was assigned to the Covington Astros of the Appalachian League.
While there, he batted .252 in the 1967 season, hitting 4 home runs in 155 at-bats.
He continued to develop the following season, making appearances at three different levels of minor league baseball.
His batting average for the 1968 season was a robust .320, with a high of .338 in 195 at-bats for the Cocoa Astros of the Florida State League.
Between three levels, Mayberry hit 23 home runs and slugged .552.
He made his major league debut that season, appearing in four games but amassing no hits.
During his four-game call-up, Mayberry recalled the first time that he met Hank Aaron, who was playing for the Atlanta Braves: I just stood there looking at him,' Mayberry said. 'I said to myself, "so this is the Hammer, this is Henry Aaron.
At 20 years old, Mayberry played 123 games for the Oklahoma City 89ers of the AAA-level American Association.
With 21 home runs, a .303 batting average, and a .522 slugging percentage, his power began to resemble the man he met the year before in the majors.
He batted in 78 runs and scored 95, walking more times than he struck out (62/42).
Mayberry's second short stint in the majors did not result in his first hit, though he did make it on base with one walk in five plate appearances.
That would not come until the following year; after playing 70 games at Oklahoma City and batting .273 with 13 home runs, Mayberry was called up to the Houston Astros.
Mayberry played in 50 games during his first extended stint in "the Show", with his first career hit coming in April 1970 before he was sent back down to AAA.
It came against the San Francisco Giants in a 7–4 loss; he hit a single to right field off of Giants right-hander Frank Reberger.
The 1971 season was yet another year split between the minor leagues and the major leagues.
While he hit .324 with 13 home runs in 64 games in the minors that year, Mayberry could only muster a .182 batting average in 46 games with Houston, hitting seven home runs and striking out 32 times.
The Astros tried to turn Mayberry into a slap hitter rather than utilizing his natural power: They wanted me to cut down on my strikeouts,' he said, 'but all long ball hitters seem to strike out a lot, don't they?
What happened was that I not only wasn't cutting down on my strikeouts, but I wasn't hitting the long ball any more either.
In the 1971 offseason, the Astros traded Mayberry, along with Dave Graangard, to the Kansas City Royals for Lance Clemons and Jim York.
The trade was regarded as one of the worst in baseball history.
Mayberry was a classic slugging first baseman who batted left-handed.
In his first season with the Royals, he hit 25 home runs and drove in 100 runs.
His 78 walks were slightly more than his 74 strikeouts, and his .298 batting average came with the re-discovery of his power stroke.
The 1973 season produced nearly identical statistics, but yielded better production.
Mayberry led the league in walks (122) and on-base percentage (.417) while still batting .278, hitting 26 home runs, and driving in 100 for the second consecutive season.
Mayberry's pure statistics, though, were even more remarkable in light of the fact that the Royals had no other power hitters in the lineup to protect him.
Other than center fielder Amos Otis, who equaled Mayberry's 1973 home run total, no other Royals batter achieved double-digits in home runs. 1975 was widely considered Mayberry's best season in Kansas City.
He set career marks in doubles, home runs, runs scored, and RBI.
His 34 home runs in a season were a Royals team record when he retired after the 1982 season.
He was named the American League Player of the Month in July 1975 for hitting 12 home runs and posting a .365 batting average, and he hit three home runs in a game against future Hall of Famer Ferguson Jenkins.
He also had an eight-game stretch during which he hit eight home runs.
But his good fortune was not to continue.
Mayberry's statistics declined drastically in 1976 and 1977.
He amassed a .232 batting average and only 13 home runs in 1976.
Mayberry's home run production rebounded slightly in 1977; he hit 23 home runs, earning him a tie for the Royals team lead (with right fielder Al Cowens) in that department.
But his batting average remained low at .230, and his RBI total declined from 95 in 1976 to 82 in 1977.
On August 5, 1977, Mayberry went 4-for-5 against the Chicago White Sox, hitting a single off Chris Knapp, a home run and a triple off Bart Johnson, and a double off Don Kirkwood to complete the cycle; the Royals won the game, 12–2.
During the 1977 American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees, Mayberry arrived late for the fourth game, which was played in the afternoon, after a late-night outing.
Mayberry played very poorly on both offense (striking out twice in two plate appearances) and defense (dropping a foul pop and a routine infield throw).
Mayberry's ragged play prompted manager Whitey Herzog to bench him midway through Game Four and to leave him out of the starting lineup for the decisive fifth game.
Herzog later blamed Mayberry for the Royals' failure to defeat the Yankees in the ALCS and demanded Mayberry's dismissal from the team, even though he also said he had "always loved the way John played".
Consequently, before the start of the 1978 season, the Royals sold Mayberry to the Toronto Blue Jays, who were beginning their second season of play in the American League. "Big John" hit the final Royals home run ever at Kansas City's Municipal Stadium on September 29, 1972 in a 9-2 Royals win over the Oakland Athletics.
Oakland's Gene Tenace hit the final home run in the stadium's history the following night as the A's defeated the Royals 10-5.
Mayberry was with Toronto for the 1978 through 1981 seasons, and part of the 1982 season.
With Toronto, hit above .250 only in 1979, and had highs of 30 home runs and 82 RBIs in 1980; his production never returned to his 1975 level.
In his last three seasons, Mayberry began to strike out more than walk, a trend that differed from his early career.
During his time with the Blue Jays, he played in a total of 549 games, batting .256 with 92 home runs and 272 RBIs.
In May 1982, Toronto traded Mayberry to the New York Yankees.
Mayberry appeared in 69 games for the Yankees with a .209 average; his playing time was reduced during August and September.
Overall for the 1982 season, Mayberry batted .218 with 10 home runs and 30 RBIs.
After finishing the season with the Yankees, he retired.
Mayberry was an All-Star twice in his career (1973–1974).
In 15 seasons, he compiled a .253 batting average with 255 home runs and 879 RBI.
He had 1,379 career hits in 5,447 at bats.
He shares the record for most home runs in a season without hitting a double, with 7 in 1971.
Upon his retirement, he held both the Royals (34 in 1975) and Blue Jays franchise records for home runs in a single season.
Mayberry had a sharp eye at the plate as evidenced by his leading the American League in walks (bases on balls) twice 1973 and 1975 and leading the American League with Intentional walks (bases on balls) with 17 in 1973.
Mayberry still holds several Royals single season records including most walks in a season with 122 (1973), and most home runs on the road with 23 (1975).
After his retirement, Mayberry spent five years as a coach for the Blue Jays' farm system, two years as a coach for the Royals, and worked for the Royals' Community Affairs Department.
He was inducted into the Royals Hall of Fame in 1996.
Mayberry's son, John Jr., was an outfielder in major league baseball from 2009 through 2015, mostly with the Philadelphia Phillies.
When watching his son's first game at Yankee Stadium, the Fox telecast incorrectly identified Mayberry Sr. in the stands.
When told of the incident, John Jr. said, "I got a kick out of that".
John Jr. hit his first two career home runs in 2009 against his father's last two teams. , or Baseball Almanac, or Retrosheet
Tom Lloyd was first cousin to Ned and Dan Kelly, the so-called fifth member of the Kelly Gang.
J.J. Kenneally interviewed him for his 1929 book, "The Inner History of the Kelly Gang," the first sympathetic account of the gang and the first to incorporate information from him.
Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester and 1st Earl of Lincoln (1170–1232), known in some references as the 4th Earl of Chester (in the second lineage of the title after the original family line was broken after the 2nd Earl), was one of the "old school" of Anglo-Norman barons whose loyalty to the Angevin dynasty was consistent but contingent on the receipt of lucrative favours.
He was described as "almost the last relic of the great feudal aristocracy of the Conquest".
Ranulf, born in 1170, was the eldest son of Hugh de Kevelioc and Bertrade de Montfort of Evreux.
He was said to have been small in physical stature.
He succeeded to the earldom of Chester (like his father before him) as a minor (aged eleven) and was knighted in 1188 or 1189, which gave him control of his estates in England and Normandy.
Although he used, not inconsistently, the style "Duke of Brittany", he never had the control of the duchy, and is not known to have played an important role there.
In 1188 or 1189, he was married to the Duchess Constance of Brittany, the widow of Henry II's son Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, and mother of Arthur of Brittany, with whom King John contested the succession to the crown of England.
Richard Coeur de Lion, John's brother, had no known legitimate issue.
The King had named Arthur of Brittany as his adopted son and heir to the crown of England.
Henry did not envy the Duchess and wanted her married to a magnate whom he could trust.
The marriage gave Ranulf control of the earldom of Richmond, but it wasn't a success, and they separated.
In 1196, King Richard I of England nominated the nine-year-old Arthur as his heir, and summoned him and his mother, Duchess Constance, to Normandy.
Constance left Nantes and travelled towards Rouen.
On the way she was abducted by her estranged husband.
Richard, furious, marched to Brittany at the head of an army, intent on rescuing his nephew.
Arthur was secretly taken away by his tutor to the French court to be brought up with Louis, son of the French king Philip II.
In 1199, Constance escaped from her husband and their marriage was dissolved on the grounds of desertion.
In 1200 Ranulf cemented his power in Normandy by marrying Clemence of Fougères; she was the daughter of William of Fougères, widow of Alan de Dinant, and sister of Geoffrey of Fougères.
He had opposed John's attempted coup of 1193–4, and retained many contacts with partisans of his former stepson Arthur.
He spent most of 1199–1204 in France and his continued loyalty was bought by John with further patronage.
However the King was suspicious of the Earl, perhaps with some reason.
In the winter of 1204–5, Ranulph, suspected of dealings with the rebellious Welsh and of contemplating revolt himself, had extensive estates temporarily confiscated by the king.
This episode apparently convinced Ranulph to show loyalty in future.
Thereafter he was showered with royal favours.
In return he fought John's Welsh wars 1209–12; helped secure the peace with the pope in 1213–14, and was with the king in Poitou in 1214.
Loyal to the king in 1215–16, he was one of the few magnates to witness the Magna Carta of 1215, which he would later adapt to appease his own barons in the form of the Magna Carta of Chester.
He played a leading military role in the civil war by virtue of his extensive estates and numerous castles.
Ranulf stood with William Marshal and the Earls of Derby and Warwick with the King, whilst the other nobility of the land stood with the enemy or remained aloof from the conflict.
Chester was appointed in 1215 Lord of the County of Lancashire with the power to appoint sheriffs.
He was also High Sheriff of Lancashire, High Sheriff of Staffordshire and High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1216.
On John's death in 1216, Ranulf's influence increased further.
There was an expectation at Gloucester that Ranulf would contend the regency for the young Henry III.
Events moved quickly at Gloucester, where William Marshal and the young king were, in Ranulph's absence.
The Marshal was put forward and offered the regency by the nobility and clerics gathered at Gloucester before the arrival of Ranulph.
There was concern that Ranulph might object to the decision, but when he arrived (29 October 1216) he stated that he did not want to be regent, so any potential conflict vanished.
Before John's death, rebel barons had offered the throne of England to Louis, the dauphin.
Louis had invaded the country during the summer of 1216 and had taken Winchester.
De Blondeville put his political weight behind re-issuing the Magna Carta in 1216 and 1217; his military experience was used in defeating the rebels at Lincoln in 1217.
Ranulph was based in the north midlands and was charged with stopping the northern barons linking up with Louis in the south.
The Earl chose to combine personal concerns with those of the country by attacking Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester's castle at Mountsorrel in Leicestershire – from which the Earl of Winchester's predecessors had ousted Ranulph's grandfather, Ranulf de Gernon.
Louis was persuaded by the Earl of Winchester to send a relief force to the castle.
When they arrived, de Blondeville and the Royalist force were gone.
In fact they had headed to Lincoln to deal with a French force besieging the castle there.
William Marshal with his main army at Northampton also made for the city, and at Lincoln a battle was fought between the Royalists headed by William Marshal and de Blondeville and the French forces and their allies.
The battle went in favour of the Royalists, and they captured forty-six Barons and the Earls of Winchester and Hereford and the Earl of Lincoln, recently created by Louis the French King.
Following the battle in recognition of his support Ranulf was created Earl of Lincoln by King Henry III of England on 23 May 1217.
In 1218, de Blondeville decided to honour the crusading vow he had made three years previously, and he journeyed eastwards.
He met up with the Count of Nevers and the Count of La Marche in Genoa, accompanied by the Earls of Derby, Arundel and Winchester.
They then sailed on towards Egypt and the Nile.
An icy winter in camp was followed by a burning summer which affected the morale of the crusaders greatly.
During September 1219, the Sultan, wary of the conflict outside Damietta, offered the Crusaders a startling bargain – Bethlehem, Nazareth, Jerusalem and central Palestine and Galilee, so long as the Crusaders gave up their war in Egypt.
Earl Ranulph was one of many voices in support of taking the offer, and was supported by his English peers.
However, Bishop Pelagius, the Patriarch of Jerusalem and the military orders would have none of it.
They finally refused the offer and on 5 November they found the walls of Damietta poorly manned, so they attacked and secured the city.
When winter came the army was smouldering with discontent.
Earl Ranulf left Damietta in September 1220, with his fellow English earls, leaving behind an indecisive force under the command of Bishop Pelagius and the Military Orders.
Upon the crusade's failure he returned to England to find his rival, William Marshal dead and the government in the hands of Hubert de Burgh.
From 1220 to 1224, tensions grew between government officials and old loyalists of King John.
This flared into open conflict in the winter of 1223–4 when Ranulf among others briefly tried to resist de Burgh's policy of resumption of sheriffdoms and royal castles.
Ranulf built Bolingbroke Castle near Spilsby in Lincolnshire around 1220, later the birthplace of King Henry IV, as well as Chartley Castle Staffordshire, and Beeston Castle in Cheshire.
Ranulf was briefly made castellan of Wallingford Castle.
He made an alliance with Llywelyn the Great, whose daughter Elen married Ranulf's nephew and heir, John the Scot, in about 1222.
De Blondeville's final years saw him acting as an elder statesman, witnessing the 1225 re-issue of the Magna Carta, playing a prominent role in the dispute in 1227 over Forest Laws and, as a veteran, leading Henry III's army on the ill-fated Poitou expedition of 1230–1.
He came to lead the campaign after the death of William Marshal (the younger).
He showed vigour and made a thrust into Anjou, but by the end of June the French had reached the Breton border.
Ranulf concluded the campaign with a truce with the King of France for three years, to end in 1234.
Earl Ranulf kept in sight his personal advantage.
In 1220 some of his estates avoided carucage; in 1225 Aid was not levied in Cheshire; and in 1229 he successfully resisted the ecclesiastical tax collector.
His only major failure, in old age, was not avoiding the 1232 levy of the fortieth on his lands.
Ranulf died at Wallingford on 26 October 1232, aged sixty.
His viscera were buried at Wallingford Castle, his heart at Dieulacres Abbey, which he had founded, and the remainder of his body at St Werburg's in Chester.
His various estates were divided between his four sisters Matilda (Maud), Mabel, Agnes (Alice), and Hawise as co-heirs.
Ranulf's second sister Mabel and his eldest sister Matilda (Maud) shared in the estates with their other sisters.
Ranulf's third sister Agnes (Alice) inherited, along with a share in other estates with her sisters, lands between the Ribble and the Mercy rivers, Powis Castle near Welshpool in Wales, Chartley Castle, Staffordshire, and land at Bugbrooke, Northamptonshire.
Ranulf's youngest sister Hawise inherited the honour and castle of Bolingbroke, other large estates such as Lindsey and Halland in Lincolnshire, and a share of other estates with her sisters.
Prior to Ranulf's death, however, he had also made Hawise, his youngest sister an "inter vivos" gift, after receiving dispensation from the crown, of the Earldom of Lincoln.
In April 1231 he granted her the title by a formal charter under his seal which was confirmed by King Henry III.
She was formally invested as "suo jure" 1st Countess of Lincoln on 27 October 1232 the day after Ranulf's death.
She held the Earldom of Lincoln until less than a month later with the consent of the King she likewise gifted the Earldom "inter vivos" to her daughter Margaret de Quincy and her son-in-law John de Lacy, 2nd Earl of Lincoln.
They were formally invested by King Henry III as Countess and Earl of Lincoln on 23 November 1232.
After his death, his nephew John the Scot (son of his eldest sister Matilda (Maud) of Chester), was formally invested by King Henry III as Earl of Chester on 21 November 1232, which suggests a prior agreement.
As an important figure in the reigns of Richard I and King John, Ranulf appears in novels set in the period.
Ranulf de Blondeville is a supporting character in James Goldman's 1979 novel "Myself as Witness" set in the reign of King John.
Goldman's narrator describes Ranulf as the "only living Visigoth" and condemns him for killing many Welshman in his capacity as an Anglo-Norman lord of the Welsh Marches.
He is represented as a brutal and aggressive opponent of all things, and people, Welsh.
He appears early in Sharon Kay Penman's novel "Falls the Shadow", on the life and career of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, when he promises to personally support Simon's appeal to the king to recognise his right to the impoverished Leicester earldom.
Ranulf makes a brief appearance in Lauren Johnson's 2013 novel "The Arrow of Sherwood" participating at the siege of Nottingham in 1194.
Ranulf is mentioned several times over the course of the 1980s television series "Robin of Sherwood".

OpenBiome is a nonprofit organization in Somerville, Massachusetts which operates a public stool bank and supports research on the human microbiome.
OpenBiome distributes material to hospitals and clinics to support the treatment of "C. difficile", the most common pathogen causing hospital-acquired infection in the U.S. OpenBiome provides frozen preparations of screened and filtered human stool for use in fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) therapies.
OpenBiome can provide clinicians with three different formulations: a high-concentration "FMP 30" formulation for delivery via the upper gastrointestinal tract, a lower-concentration "FMP 250" for delivery via the lower gastrointestinal tract, and, as of October 2015, a capsule formulation.
As of March 2017, OpenBiome had provided over 20,000 treatments to 50 states and 7 countries.
In 2015, OpenBiome announced the launch of PersonalBiome, a stool banking program through which individuals could store their stool for future use in fecal transplantation after microbial dysbiosis.
OpenBiome was founded in 2012 by Mark Smith, a microbiology student at MIT, and James Burgess, an MBA student at the MIT Sloan School of Management.
It is the first public stool bank, and was founded to facilitate use of FMT.
The logistical burdens associated with screening and processing fecal material have made it difficult for clinicians to offer FMT to patients with recurrent "C. difficile" infections.

Margrét Þorbjörg Thors Hallgrímsson (born Reykjavík on April 22, 1902, died September 2, 1996) was a matriarch of one of the most powerful families in Iceland in the twentieth century.
She was the eighth child of Margrét Þorbjörg Kristjánsdóttir and Thor Philip Axel Jensen, one of Iceland's most powerful businessmen, and the last of them to die.
On November 17, 1928, Margrét Þorbjörg married the businessman Hallgrímur Fr.
Hallgrímsson (1905-1989), with whom she had Margrét Þóra Hallgrímsson and Elína Benta.
Participants in an online music scene who rearrange spliced parts of musical pieces form mashup culture.
The audio-files are normally in MP3 format and spliced with audio-editing software online.
The new, edited song is called mashup.
The expression mashup culture is also strongly connected to mashup in music.
Even though it is originally not a political community, the producer of mash-up music are related to the issue of copyright.
Mashup Culture is even regarded as "a response to larger technological, institutional, and social contexts".
The history of mashup culture in general can be dated back to the beginnings of dada and conceptual art.
Artists such as Marcel Duchamp were the first to introduce already existing objects, which they rearranged and combined in collages, to the world of higher art.
These artists believed that even though certain artifacts were ascribed a certain meaning, this meaning could be altered through rearranging them and putting them into a new context.
However, it was still quite a long way to the beginning of mashup culture in music.
From the early 2000s on, music was more and more distributed through the internet.
With the introduction of MP3 audio files, it became much easier to access and download music.
Not only could music be accessed easier, it could also be transformed and mixed in ways that were not possible before.
Especially for younger people, this new gained freedom when it came to the accessibility of audio files lead to the development of a new form of cult around the transformation of musical pieces.
This "reworking MP3 recordings pulled from the Internet" was turning into more than just a fashion just as "the Internet is more than just a means of distribution, it becomes a "raison d’eˆtre" for a culture based on audio data’’ states Alistair Riddell in 2001.
During that time, the first versions of mashup music were published, sometimes not under the term "mashup" but under the name of "creative bootleg" or "bastard pop".
Even though the creation of a new song by combining at least two samples of different songs was also used in other music styles such as Hip Hop before, it was only with the rise of the MP3 audio file along with easy-to-use computer mash-up programs that mash-up was transformed into an own culture as such.
Especially peer-to-peer sharing was contributing to this phenomenon: People who create mashup music can easily distribute it and share it with other people through online programs.
Mashup culture is motivated by a number of different factors.
Mashup culture is sometimes regarded as a cultural movement against common, existing music that is published by the music industry.
In 2002, a "Newsweek" article described the mashup of songs as a strategy of Londoner DJs to transform music they considered bad into something they could appreciate and were willing to listen to.
Even though mashup culture has its origin in online communities, it entered a more art-related realm.
It is art used as a statement against the content music industry provides.
It can even be considered as a political statement against copyright laws and restrictions imposed by the government as well. "Reframing of the original narrative" is regarded as a way to create a new and unique product which leads to a "fresh perspective" of the original.
Murray states "there’s the question of the kind of Internet we want moving forward – one increasingly controlled by corporate gatekeepers who get to sanction what creative expression looks like, or one in which the freedom of this expression is valued above share price".
Copyright issues have always been limiting the possibilities of mashup culture.
Those implications by law have led to the problem of online piracy.
Mashups are often created with illegally acquired content.
This closeness to illegality has become part of this culture. "In some cases, the illegality of piracy contributes to the appeal of unauthorized copies online" states Shiga in her article Copy-and-Persist: The Logic of Mash-Up Culture.
Even though copyright laws were intentionally supposed to stop illegal downloads, they contributed to the appeal of mashup and to the culture existing around it.
Another important aspect of the success of mashup culture nowadays lies in the do-it-yourself or DIY trend.
Consumers are turning into producers as well, especially due to the simplification of online tools that help creating personalized content.
Paul D. Miller, also known as DJ Spooky, published a book about how mashup culture transforms our society.
In "Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture", he investigates "the nature of that transformation" stating that "rapid advances in technology [that] have transformed art and communication".
He describes sampling as an essential part of our society.
The book was published by the MIT Press and highly recognized by scholars such as Lawrence Lessig.

Journal October is the debut album by cellist David Darling recorded in 1979 and released on the ECM label.
The Allmusic review by Ron Wynn awarded the album 4 stars stating "Although not strictly a jazz album, David Darling's 1979 solo release, "Journal October", deserves attention.
His technique is amazing, even if a lot of times he's more interested in colors and textures than in rhythms.
He's certainly influenced by contemporary classical music, and at times things get so introspective he almost seems detached.
But it's worth investigating, for Darling is capable of exciting statements".

Charles Taylor Bernard, Sr. (September 10, 1927 – June 27, 2015) was an American businessman and politician originally from Earle in Crittenden County in eastern Arkansas.
He is best known as the 1968 Republican nominee for the United States Senate seat held by long-time Democrat J. William Fulbright of Fayetteville.
Bernard attended Baylor University in Waco, Texas, where he became enamored with the poetry of Robert Browning, whom he often quoted.
He farmed cotton at Earle and operated One Hour Marvelizing dry cleaning establishments in eastern Arkansas.
In 2013, he was listed as a resident of Naples, Florida.
His obituary indicates that he also resided in Maui, Hawaii.
Bernard and his wife, the former Betty Hill (born c. 1931), who still resides in Earle, had five children: Sallie Hill Armstrong (husband Robert) of Reno, Nevada; Mary Troy Johnston (Kauai, Hawaii), Charles Taylor Bernard, Jr., and wife Elaine of Memphis, Tennessee; David Wesley Bernard and wife Virginia Caris of Birmingham, Alabama, and John Harbert Bernard and wife Mary Reynolds of Atlanta, Georgia.
His obituary indicated that after the middle 1980s he lived with Jaynie Moon (born c. 1941).
The obituary does not indicated if he divorced Betty.
At the age of seventy-five, Bernard hiked with all the men of his family to the bottom of the Grand Canyon; at eighty-two, he completed a seven-mile combination kayak tour and trail to the waterfall in the Wailua River Valley on Kauai, Hawaii.
Although Fulbright was comfortably re-elected, Bernard, later the Republican state chairman from 1971 to 1973, was his strongest Republican rival, for in all previous contests Fulbright had been returned to office unopposed or without significant opposition.
In the primary, Fulbright had handily defeated James D. Johnson of Conway, a segregationist Democrat who had lost the 1966 gubernatorial general election to Republican Winthrop Rockefeller.
Fulbright won his final election with 59.2 percent to Bernard's 40.2 percent.
Bernard's ticket mate, Governor Rockefeller, scored a second two-year term by defeating the Democrat Marion H. Crank of Foreman in Little River County in southwestern Arkansas.
Crank had earlier defeated Johnson's wife, Virginia Morris Johnson, in the Democratic gubernatorial runoff election.
In 1970, Bernard and then Republican State Representative George E. Nowotny of Fort Smith both considered running for governor had Rockefeller not sought a third term.
Bernard won the state chairmanship to succeed Odell Pollard of Searcy in White County in balloting before the GOP State Committee held in Little Rock after Rockefeller's defeat for governor in 1970.
Bernard defeated Rockefeller's stated choice, William T. Kelly, Sr., of Little Rock, the Pulaski County chairman, and Everett Ham, a Rockefeller aide.
The vote was 137 for Bernard, 28 for Kelly, and 27 for Ham.
Delegates then named Ham as the vice chairman.
John L. Ward, a Rockefeller biographer, said that Rockefeller's aides "felt like Bernard and the party had kicked Rockefeller's teeth in."
Years later, Robert Faulkner, Rockefeller's executive secretary in 1970, said that Bernard's victory for the chairmanship showed that many pre-Rockefeller Republicans in Arkansas "couldn't wait to throw out the Rockefeller influence and pick their own, more conservative, traditional Republican."
However, Bernard's obituary indicates that he like Rockefeller was a strong defender of civil rights.
During his chairmanship, Governor Ronald W. Reagan of California visited Bernard while Reagan was in Arkansas to campaign for various Republican candidates.
Bernard died in Memphis, Tennessee, at the age of eighty-seven, but it is unclear if he was a Memphis resident in his last years.
He was cremated.
According to his obituary, Bernard "always remained a combination of a small town boy and larger than life figure, making himself big enough for any challenge but always remaining a true Southern gentleman.
The following is a list of fictional characters that first appeared in the BBC soap opera "EastEnders" in 1996, by order of first appearance.
Michael Rose, played by Russell Floyd, first appears in Walford as a Market Inspector in 1996.
He initially has very few storylines, but he is chosen to be the best man at Terry Raymond (Gavin Richards)'s wedding (which is later called off).
He has a crush on April Branning (Debbie Arnold) but no relationship ever develops between them.
Then there is the arrival of his teenage son Matthew (Joe Absolom) and former wife Susan Rose (Tilly Vosburgh) in 1997.
His ex-wife Susan is suffering from multiple sclerosis and Michael ends up caring for her.
Eventually he and Susan get back together and seem happy until the arrival of Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin) who is also a Market Inspector.
He and Lisa become attracted to each other and have an affair behind Susan's back.
Michael ends the affair and decides to leave Walford with Susan and start a new life in Leeds, with Susan unaware of the affair.
He returns occasionally in 1999 when his son Matthew is wrongly imprisoned for the murder of Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor).
Michael's last appearance is in October 1999, attending Matthew's trial.
When the jury returns a guilty verdict Michael screams that his son is innocent.
Dan Zappieri, played by Carl Pizzie, made his first screen appearance on 19 March 1996.
Pizzie was out of work and had just opened a bar with fellow actor Nick Pickard when he was cast as Dan. "EastEnders" was his first major television role.
Pizzie relished the chance to play a bad guy role, as he had only ever played "regular guys" before.
Dan was a drug dealer, who befriended Tony Hills (Mark Homer).
They sold drugs together and Pizzie commented that Tony was easily drawn into Dan's world as he thought it was exciting and he liked having money.
When two of Dan's customers suffered serious side effects from his drugs, he was unconcerned and Pizzie noted that all Dan cared about was money.
He said "He likes playing the bad guy, he thinks his life is a bit like an Al Pacino movie."
Pizzie found parts of Dan's storylines challenging to play, as he did not touch drugs.
But he liked that the show was tackling the subject matter and the negative effects taking drugs had on people.
An "Inside Soap" columnist branded the character "Desperate Dan" and "Walford's latest villain".
Aunt Sal is played by Anna Karen, and has appeared sporadically since 21 March 1996, usually for only one or two episodes at a time.
She is Peggy Mitchell's (Barbara Windsor) sister.
Ben Mitchell has been played by five different actors.
Matthew Silver appeared as an infant Ben from 1996 to 1998, and Morgan Whittle played him as a toddler from 1999 to 2000.
After a six-year absence from the series, Charlie Jones assumed the role of Ben in 2006.
Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood axed Jones as part of a series revamp in 2010; the role was recast to Joshua Pascoe later that year.
Pascoe portrayed Ben until 24 August 2012, when he was sent to prison for the murder of Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison).
Ben returned to the serial in September 2014, with the role recast to Harry Reid, before departing on 12 January 2018.
Havingously appeared as a baby and a toddler, Ben returned to "EastEnders" in 2006 played by child actor Charlie Jones.
Jones was cast alongside Megan Jossa, who would play his cousin Courtney Mitchell.
While Ben is partially deaf, Jones is a hearing actor. "The Guardian" Rebecca Atkinson suggested that, as only the second disabled character in "EastEnders" history, Ben was introduced to fulfil a BBC quota.
She criticised Jones' casting, and opined, "The use of able-bodied actors to play disabled characters is endemic.
Maybe in theory there's nothing wrong with that, but while real disabled people are invisible it is downright offensive to persistently cast able-bodied people in disabled roles."
Joe Wicks, played by Paul Nicholls, appears on screen between 25 March 1996 and 14 November 1997. "EastEnders" was praised for the character's portrayal of schizophrenia.
"EastEnders" story editor, Ian Aldwinkle, decided to introduce a character with schizophrenia after working on the drama series "Casualty", which featured violent and dramatic incidents involving people with the illness, but only focussed on the medical side.
Aldwinkle researched the illness and says he was shocked to discover that it affects one in 100 people, but it was rarely spoken about.
He said: "Because it has a continuing storyline, "EastEnders" was able to look at the effect that schizophrenia has on a family and on individual relationships.
I wanted to humanise it and look at the emotional impact it has on people."
He said he hoped that the storyline would be helpful, saying "It seems to me that mental illness is one of the last subjects that you can still make jokes about without being labelled politically incorrect, and that seems wrong.
If I get just one letter from one person saying that the character of Joe Wicks has helped to change their life for the better, then I will be pleased."
Lorraine Wicks, played by Jacqueline Leonard, is introduced in April 1996, as the former wife of the already established character David Wicks (Michael French).
She is brought into the serial along with her son Joe Wicks (Paul Nicholls).
Author Kate Lock has described Lorraine as "relentlessly sensible, fair and nice" but with a "rogue gene" that prompted her to select the wrong kind of men.
As well as a high-profile storyline concentrating on Joe's diagnosis of schizophrenia, Lorraine's most prominent storyline is a love triangle between herself, Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) and Grant's wife Tiffany (Martine McCutcheon).
In the storyline, Lorraine discovers that Tiffany is keeping a secret from Grant – that he is potentially not the father of her unborn child.
When Tiffany refuses to tell Grant the truth, Lorraine does, making way for them to become a legitimate couple, albeit briefly.
Leonard commented in December 1996, "Lorraine has had a year on her own and she feels that she probably needs a bit of contact – and Grant's quite macho.
It was very interesting from my point of view because Lorraine could be perceived as being bitchy and she's not.
She genuinely cares about Tiffany and their marriage and the baby and she wants the whole situation sorted out.
But she and Grant do like each other and care about each other and it loses control a bit."
Alistair Matthews, played by Neil Clark, is a store manager who catches Sarah Hills (Daniela Denby-Ashe) shoplifting in April 1996, but promises not to call the police if she attends his Christian fellowship and turns her back on her sinful ways.
Sarah is captivated by Alistair's Christian preachings and joins his fellowship.
Frankie Pierre (Syan Blake) is drawn to Alistair too, and when he turns her advances down, she spreads rumours that they were sexually involved; although Alistair publicly denies this, causing Frankie's downfall in Walford.
Alistair condemns Sarah for having pre-marital sex with Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney) during a crisis of faith.
However, Sarah is hurt to discover that Alistair does not practice the piety that he preaches, and when she realises that he is having pre-marital sex with his girlfriend Sue Taylor (Charlotte Bellamy), she denounces him publicly in front of his congregation.
Jim Branning is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera "EastEnders", played by John Bardon.
First appearing on 29 April 1996 and becoming a regular character in 1999, he remains in the series right until 2011.
Jim was written out of the show in August 2007 due to Bardon suffering a stroke.
A storyline was created where Jim also suffers a stroke.
It was reported on 10 March 2008 that Bardon would be returning to the role of Jim in summer 2008.
Bardon returned to film four episodes in the latter half of 2008.
He returned permanently from the episode broadcast on 20 August 2009.
On 1 April 2011 it was reported by the "Daily Mirror" that Bardon had filmed his final scenes and had left.
He departed on 26 May 2011.
On the behest of producer John Yorke in 2000, Jim was paired romantically with pensioner Dot Cotton, played by June Brown; a slow courtship is featured, with Dot often shown to be outraged by Jim's advances, resulting in numerous rejections.
Dot finally succumbs and accepts his marriage proposal in an episode that first aired in November 2001; the scenes were filmed inside one of the carriages of the London Eye on the South Bank of the River Thames.
Their wedding first aired on 14 February 2002, Valentine's Day. "The Guardian" critic, Nancy Banks-Smith, described the wedding as "uniquely uneventful [...] For Dot and Jim 'In sickness and health... till death do us part' seemed to carry more resonance than for most."
Suzy Branning (originally known as Sue) is the daughter of Jim and Reenie Branning (John Bardon and Joy Graham).
She is first seen in 1996 for her sister April Branning (Debbie Arnold)'s wedding to her fiancé Nikos, along with her children, Rebecca and Kevin.
Initially played by Julie Christian-Young in 1996, Maggie O'Neill took over the role in 2008.
O'Neill began filming in May 2008, and she made her first on-screen appearance as Suzy on 8 July 2008.
She made her last appearance on Boxing Day 2008.
Derek Branning, played by Terence Beesley in 1996 and Jamie Foreman from 2011 to 2012, is the eldest child of Jim Branning (John Bardon) and Reenie Branning (Joy Graham).
Derek made his first appearance on 29 April 1996 and departed not long after.
The character returned as a regular character on 24 November 2011, played by Foreman.
Derek is originally portrayed as a racist and is against his sister Carol (Lindsey Coulson) marrying Alan (Howard Antony).
Derek is described as a "charmer" and "proper East-End".
In an interview with "Daybreak", Foreman said he wants viewers to "like Derek".
Discussing Derek's personality, Foreman told "TV Choice": "There's always this little undercurrent of, 'This guy isn't who we want around for long', if you see what I mean.
Derek's just come back from a 10-year prison sentence for armed robbery.
He's a very complicated character, who could either be perceived as a bully or as someone who cares for his family very much."
The character was killed off on Christmas Day 2012, after suffering a heart attack.
Reenie Branning played by Joy Graham, is the first wife of Jim Branning (John Bardon), and mother of Derek Branning (Terence Beesley/Jamie Foreman), April Branning (Debbie Arnold), Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson), Sue Branning (Julie Christian-Young/Maggie O'Neill), Max Branning (Jake Wood) and Jack Branning (Scott Maslen).
Reenie is said to be very maternal and dotes on all of her children, despite their faults.
She is particularly close to her oldest daughter April, whilst her relationships with daughters Carol and Suzy are notably strained due to their choice of lifestyle.
Reenie appears on-screen in April 1996, in the lead-up to April's wedding to her fiancé Nikos.
She does not appear alongside her children Max or Jack, as they were written into the series much later.
Off-screen, in October 1999 it is revealed that Reenie is critically ill, and her daughter Carol leaves Walford to care for her.
A few weeks later Reenie dies.
Huw Edwards, played by Richard Elis, is introduced in 1996 and remains on-screen till 1999.
Welsh actor Richard Elis was cast in the minor role of Huw for a period of three episodes in 1996; however, producers enjoyed the character and his contract was extended.
It was reported in December 1998 that executive producer Matthew Robinson had axed Huw because the character was "going nowhere".
However, Elis claimed in 2010 that he decided to leave the role in 1999 after three years playing Huw as he feared being typecast.
Elis has commented, "My agent at the time told me that if you are in a soap for three years, it takes three years for the viewers to forget you, whereas if you are in one for five years, it takes another 10 years before they forget you.
I just felt it was time to go.
It was great to be on it but it was just a job to me."

The house is situated next to Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt)'s and they manage to make an enemy of him by continually playing their music extremely loudly in the evening, and they also operate a pirate radio station from the premises for a while.
As well as his bar work, Lenny is also hired as a cab driver by Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson) in 1997.
Lenny spends most of his time drinking, playing poker and throwing parties.
Lenny is also a womaniser, and he takes an immediate shine to Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer).
He constantly pursues her and even though she is dating Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) at the time, they have a one-night stand, which results in a pregnancy scare.

After the Cobra Club closes following a police raid, Lenny loses his job and both he and Huw are unable to pay their rent on time.
Mark and Ruth decide to ask them to vacate the property, but they refuse and claim squatters' rights instead.

Lenny is furious, but as it is now just him in the house, Mark and Ruth decide to let him stay on as a lodger and they move back in.
He stays with them for several months until he patches up his differences with Huw and they both then decide to squat in one of the flats at 47 Albert Square.
Lenny has a keen interest in speedway motorbike racing, and takes Ricky Butcher along with him on one occasion.
Ricky turns out to be quite a skilled racer and Lenny is soon persuading him to take up speedway racing professionally so he can be his manager.
He is sacked shortly after when Ricky's wife Bianca decides to take over the job in his place.
Lenny returns to work as a barman in 1998, firstly for Annie Palmer (Nadia Sawalha) at the Market Cellar until she fires him, and then for Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) at the e20.
In 1998 Lenny's womanising catches up with him when his ex-girlfriend, Alice McMahon (Carli Norris), arrives in Walford with the news that she has tested positive for the sexually transmitted disease, Hepatitis B.
She fears that he may also be carrying the disease and instructs him to get tested.
Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney) overhears their conversation, and immediately informs his sister, Bianca.
Bianca is mortified, thinking that her prior tryst with Lenny has put her at risk.
This leads to Bianca admitting to Ricky that she had sex with Lenny years earlier, and this puts their relationship under severe strain.
With everyone on the Square turning against him, Lenny feels isolated and depressed.
However Huw is supportive and to Lenny's relief, his test results for Hepatitis B are negative.
Later in the year Lenny busies himself with the promotion of Mick McFarlane (Sylvester Williams)'s band and also goes to France with Huw, Barry, and Robbie to watch the 1998 World Cup.
He also begins a relationship with Teresa di Marco (Leila Birch), though it soon ends when Teresa's brother, Gianni (Marc Bannerman), finds out about it.
Gianni is aware of Lenny's womanising past, and refuses to allow Teresa to see Lenny.
After Huw leaves Walford in April 1999, Lenny remains behind working at the e20.
When Steve Owen, his boss, is imprisoned for the murder of Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor), Lenny earns the wrath of his friends for supporting Steve, instead of Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom), whom Steve has falsely named as the real murderer.
Shortly after, Lenny is offered work in a West End club, so he decides to take the offer and leaves Walford in July 1999.
Simon Raymond, played by Andrew Lynford, is introduced in 1996 as the homosexual brother of Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon).
His relationship with the bisexual character Tony Hills (Mark Homer) featured a gay kiss that caused controversy in the UK; numerous complaints were made because of its broadcasting.
Simon remained in the serial until 1999, at which time it was mutually agreed between Lynford and executive producer Matthew Robinson, that the character had run its course.
The character is given a happy ending, reuniting with his former boyfriend Tony to travel Europe.
Lynford has suggested that he and the writers of "EastEnders" intended to portray Simon as a "perfectly normal" young gay man who would entertain and educate and for whom sexuality was "no big deal".
Frankie Pierre appeared between 1996 and 1997, played by Syan Blake.
Frankie is introduced as a "super-bitch" and home wrecker.
She attempts to ruin the established relationships of several characters during her year in the soap, purposefully seducing attached men.
Frankie's arrival in June 1996 is part of a storyline that breaks up the marriage of the characters Alan and Carol Jackson (Howard Antony and Lindsey Coulson).
Frankie eventually departs in March 1997 amidst a failed attempt at seducing a religious evangelist, Alistair Matthews (Neil Clark), who had been trying to make her change her promiscuous lifestyle.
Off-screen it was reported that Syan Blake and the producers of "EastEnders" had decided to write the character out of the serial, as the actress was receiving death threats from angry fans that could not separate fact from fiction, and blamed Blake for her character's home-wrecking.
The official "EastEnders" book "Who's Who" states that Frankie "had a carnivorous approach to relationships, hunting down her quarry, devouring her victim in two gulps and then moving onto the next kill."
Mick McFarlane is played by Sylvester Williams from 24 June 1996 to 22 January 2002.
He is an easy-going guy, who hopes to make it big as a musician.
However his music career fails and he ends up selling CDs on a market stall in Albert Square.
After several ill-fated attempts at a career change, he finally gets a chance of a music career when he is asked to tour with a band.
Mick reluctantly decides to turn the offer down as he is the legal guardian of his half-sister, Kim McFarlane (Krystle Williams).
However, Kim contacts Mick's musician contact and accepts the gig on his behalf.
Kim is adamant that Mick should follow his dream, and so Mick leaves Kim in the care a relative away from the square, and leaves Walford for the tour in January 2002.
Mick is a musician and he arrives in Albert Square in June 1996, when his jazz band comes to audition for a regular gig in the Bridge Street café's night Bistro.
Alan Jackson (Howard Antony), manager of the night café, hears them play and instantly hires them.
Mick's ex-girlfriend Frankie Pierre (Syan Blake) is the singer in the band, and she maliciously ruins several relationships on the Square before she quits the band, and leaves Mick with no band, and no source of income.
He is forced to seek work elsewhere, so he starts work at the café in May 1997.
In 1998, Mick decides to reform his band and holds auditions for another singer.
After turning down many hopefuls, he finds a young female soloist named Lola Christie (Diane Parish).
Mick is immediately attracted to Lola and eventually the two start dating.
However, later in the year Lola is offered a contract as a professional singer, so she dumps Mick and the band.
Later that year Mick is visited by his mother, Josie McFarlane (Joan Hooley), on holiday from Jamaica.
Mick is nervous about Josie's visit as he has led her to believe that he is a successful musician.
She is not pleased to discover Mick is working in a café.
However, Josie has secrets of her own.
She brings a young girl named Kim (Krystle Williams) with her, claiming she is a distant relative.
However, eventually Josie admits that Kim is Mick's half sister – the result of an affair that Mick's late father had had many years before.
Kim's mother is dead and Josie took Kim in rather than see her go into care.
Josie also confesses that she had been conned in a Jamaican property scam and is now penniless.
Mick is extremely shocked to discover that his parents had deceived him for so long, but he welcomes his mother and half-sister into his life and home.
Mick soon warms to the idea of having a little sister. although he does find Kim's tagging around after him a little irksome at first.
Later that year, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) fires Mick after several residents suffer a bout of food poisoning.
In January 1999, Mick makes friends with the new doctor, Fred Fonseca (Jimi Mistry), and moves in with him.
Fred later gives Mick a loan when he decides to take over Matthew Rose's (Joe Absolom) CD stall.
Later that year, Mick, Fred and a few other Walford residents go to Brighton, where Fred attends a medical convention.
Whilst away, it becomes apparent to everyone, bar Mick, that Fred hsd something he wants to reveal.
Fred is gay and is too afraid to admit his sexuality to Mick, so takes him to a gay club in the hope that Mick might 'cotton on'.
Mick doesn't realise what Fred is trying to tell him and is extremely shocked when Fred finally confesses.
Mick is hurt that Fred has felt unable to confide in him and that Fred doesn't fancy him!
The friendship stays intact, despite Mick's mother (also Fred's receptionist) denouncing Fred's lifestyle as immoral.
Mick later starts dating barmaid/ex-prostitute, Nina Harris (Troy Titus-Adams).
However, Mick's judgmental mother causes problems here too, when she discovers Nina's past.
Mick and Josie's relationship is sorely tested, culminating in Mick branding his mother a 'lonely, bitter, old woman'.
Soon after Josie is forced to leave England after a mix-up with her visa, leaving Kim in Mick's care.
Mick and Nina's relationship ends as Nina leaves Walford to look after her dying father.
With the added financial responsibility of caring for his young sister, Mick gets a part-time job as a limousine driver for Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden).
However, he is sacked when Phil finds dog hair in the car, sparking a feud between them with Phil doing everything he can to undermine Mick.
However, despite his dislike of Phil, Mick's constant money problems make him swallow his pride and ask for his job at the café back.
He also has a spell as the radio controller for Barry Evans' (Shaun Williamson) cab firm.
Early in 2002, Mick is offered a gig as a touring saxophone player in a band, but has to turn it down, due to being Kim's legal guardian.
Soon after, he needs money to send Kim on a school trip and pleads with Phil for an advance on his wages.
Phil refuses and Mick is forced to sell his saxophone to raise the money instead.
When Kim discovers this, she buys his saxophone back with the money for her school trip, contacts Mick's musician contact and accepts the gig on his behalf.
Kim is adamant that Mick should follow his dream, and so Mick leaves Kim with a relative away from the Square, and leaves Walford himself in January 2002.
George Palmer, played by Paul Moriarty, appears between 1996 and 1998.
Actor Paul Moriarty was asked to read for the role of George along with 10 other actors.
Moriarty was called back instantly and asked to begin working on the role the following day.
He has commented to an American fan-based publication, "[It was] quite overwhelming.
I had watched the show but not religiously [...] So I show up at [the studios in] Borehamwood the very next day, straight to make-up and then onto [the soap's setting of] Albert Square to do my first bit [...] I might just as well have landed on Mars."
George had been described as "shady".
The character was one of many to be axed in 1998 by Executive Producer Matthew Robinson, following a dip in ratings.
Betty, also known as Auntie Betty, is played by Vivienne Martin.
She is Arthur Fowler's (Bill Treacher)'s aunt from Leigh-on-Sea.
Betty is mentioned several times prior to her appearance; in 1986, Arthur, his wife Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) and daughter Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) tell Pauline's mother, Lou Beale (Anna Wing), that they are visiting Betty, when in reality they are searching for their missing son Mark Fowler (David Scarboro) in Southend-on-Sea.
Later in the year, Arthur considers begging Betty for money towards Michelle's wedding to Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt); he does, but instead of money she sends Michelle a note about "what to expect of married life".
In 1988, an ailing Lou spends some time in Leigh-on-Sea with Betty, before returning home to die.
Betty appears in 1996 for Arthur's funeral, with her boyfriend Gerard.
Betty is greeted by Pauline and Mark (now Todd Carty), while Gerard makes rude and insensitive remarks about Arthur despite never meeting him, disturbing many of those present.
Betty clashes with Nellie Ellis (Elizabeth Kelly), continuing a long-standing feud dating back to World War II, when Betty had relationships with several men, including Nellie's boyfriend at the time.
In 2004, Pauline names her dog after her.
Detective Chief Inspector Charlie Mason, played by Campbell Morrison, is a detective who first appears when Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is shot by hitman John Valecue (Steve Weston), working for his wife, Cindy (Michelle Collins).
He later appears when Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) falls down the stairs at The Queen Victoria public house, and arrests Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) for her attempted murder on Christmas Day 1998.
He later appears at the inquest into Tiffany's death in January 1999.
He also investigates Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor)'s disappearance in March 1999 and appears at Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom)'s trial for her murder in October 1999.
This is his last appearance.
Terry Raymond, played by Gavin Richards, is initially introduced briefly in 1996 as the drunken father of Tiffany (Martine McCutcheon) and Simon Raymond (Andrew Lynford).
He is reintroduced as a full-time character in 1997 and remains in the serial until 2002, when actor Gavin Richards decided to leave.
It was announced that Gavin Richards quit the role in November 2001.
He commented, "I had a wonderful time but feel I have to devote my energies to other projects."
A source reportedly told the press that Richards had been unhappy in the role since the exit of his on-screen wife Irene (Roberta Taylor), as he felt that he had "not been given enough juicy storylines."
Terry was not killed off in the soap; he departed in 2002 in search of his estranged wife.
Tim Randall from the "Daily Record" suggested in 2001 that Terry and Irene's double-act was ""EastEnders" at its best", but that the relationship between Terry and Janine was "enough to turn your stomach".
A belly cast is a three-dimensional plaster sculpture of a woman's pregnant abdomen as a keepsake of her pregnancy.
It can also be known as a belly mask, pregnancy belly cast, a pregnant plaster cast, or prenatal cast.
Belly casts are most often made toward the end of the third trimester of pregnancy, though a series of casts may also be made during the pregnancy.
They are made by preparing the skin with a coating of Vaseline or a similar lubricant and adding strips of wet plaster gauze over the abdomen to make the cast.
Some women also cast their breasts, arms, hands and thighs into a full torso sculpture.
The plaster sets in about 20–30 minutes but some fast-setting strips set in five minutes.
Once set, the cast is gently removed by the mother using a wriggling motion.
It takes one or two days for the cast to dry completely.
Gesso can be painted onto the mask after drying to stop it absorbing moisture from the air.
Gesso also works as a surface primer for painting and preserving it.
The cast can be decorated with any number of finishes or designs including the baby's hand and foot prints, or left in its natural state.
Most popular decorations include painting and decoupage, while some belly casts are mosaicked.
Qumlaq (also, Khudap’erin, Kumlak, and Kumlakh) is a village in the Jabrayil Rayon of Azerbaijan.
Place des Martyres is the title of a series of over 250 watercolors and drawings executed in New York and Beirut between 1971 and 1974 by Nabil Kanso.
The subjects of the works in the series are based on the women headquartered in the red-light district of Beirut city center called el Bourj, and after World War I named Place des Martyrs French for Martyrs’ Place in memory of dozens of Arab nationalists who were hanged in 1915-16 during Ottoman rule.
The watercolors in the "Place des Martyres" series consists of approximately 170 works in 3 sizes of 44X56cm, 35X51cm, and 31X41cm.
They are characterized by transparent deep colors of red, orange, yellow, blue, and black embodying figurative imagery representing both real and imaginary scenes of the gaudy life in the city center district adjoining Place des Martyrs.
Painted in the atmosphere of pre-civil war Beirut, the compositions depict sexualized encounters and interactions of figures in various sensual situations and entertainment settings.
They make references to works of such artists as Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, Rouault, Kirchner, Nolde, Laurencin and Pascin whose “Sensual spirit seems to inspire the aquarelles and inhabit Kanso’s figures, which in a semi-erotic round, covet, touch, caress, move, and seem to emerge from a pagan fresco where time is consecrated to dance, perfume, and moments propitious to dialogue, exchange, comparison, and fleeting occasions.” Others point out that the depicted figures “assume the poses of interpretive dance without being self-conscious.
Some of the images contain poetic and bowdlerized words reflecting ironic and humorous tones with allusion to Beirut sexual market place and its social life and culture.
They show scenes of figures in the street, at the café, bar, salon, or intimate setting, and engaged in conversation, flirtation, relaxation, or transaction for the pleasure of the senses.
The figures reflect a blend of “expressive faces, beseeching, flirtatious, charming, sleepy, talkative, reluctant, and pensive.” The 80 drawings in the series seem to exist alongside the watercolors with shared expressions, subjects and thematic qualities.
They fall in sizes of 45X40cm, 45X30cm, 35X27cm, and divide themselves in two parts in which around 50 are done in pen and ink with broad cross-hatched black lines contrasting the light and dark areas, and around 30 sketch line drawings and wash embodying humorous writings.
Some of the imagery portray “lovers and nudes using heavy brush and ink technique,” and rendered in “sympathetic Germanic style.”
Synthetic lethality arises when a combination of deficiencies in the expression of two or more genes leads to cell death, whereas a deficiency in only one of these genes does not.
The deficiencies can arise through mutations, epigenetic alterations or inhibitors of one of the genes.
In a synthetic lethal genetic screen, it is necessary to begin with a mutation that does not kill the cell, although may confer a phenotype (for example, slow growth), and then systematically test other mutations at additional loci to determine which confer lethality.
Synthetic lethality has utility for purposes of molecular targeted cancer therapy, with the first example of a molecular targeted therapeutic exploiting a synthetic lethal exposed by an inactivated tumor suppressor gene (BRCA1 and 2) receiving FDA approval in 2016 (PARP inhibitor).
A sub-case of synthetic lethality, where vulnerabilities are exposed by the deletion of passenger genes rather than tumor suppressor is the so-called "collateral lethality".
The phenomenon of synthetic lethality was first described by Calvin Bridges in 1922, who noticed that some combinations of mutations in the model organism "Drosophila melanogaster" confer lethality.
Theodore Dobzhansky coined the term "synthetic lethality" in 1946 to describe the same type of genetic interaction in wildtype populations of "Drosophila".
If the combination of genetic events results in a non-lethal reduction in fitness, the interaction is called synthetic sickness.
Although in classical genetics the term synthetic lethality refers to the interaction between two genetic perturbations, synthetic lethality can also apply to cases in which the combination of a mutation and the action of a chemical compound causes lethality, whereas the mutation or compound alone are non-lethal.
Synthetic lethality is a consequence of the tendency of organisms to maintain buffering schemes that allow phenotypic stability despite genetic variation, environmental changes and random events such as mutations.
This genetic robustness is the result of parallel redundant pathways and "capacitor" proteins that camouflage the effects of mutations so that important cellular processes do not depend on any individual component.
Synthetic lethality can help identify these buffering relationships, and what type of disease or malfunction that may occur when these relationships break down, through the identification of gene interactions that function in either the same biochemical process or pathways that appear to be unrelated.
High-throughput synthetic lethal screens may help illuminate questions about how cellular processes work without previous knowledge of gene function or interaction.
Screening strategy must take into account the organism used for screening, the mode of genetic perturbation, and whether the screen is forward or reverse.
Many of the first synthetic lethal screens were performed in S. cerevisiae.
Budding yeast has many experimental advantages in screens, including a small genome, fast doubling time, both haploid and diploid states, and ease of genetic manipulation.
Gene ablation can be performed using a PCR-based strategy and complete libraries of knockout collections for all annotated yeast genes are publicly available.
Synthetic genetic array (SGA), synthetic lethality by microarray (SLAM), and genetic interaction mapping (GIM) are three high-throughput methods for analyzing synthetic lethality in yeast.
A genome scale genetic interaction map was created by SGA analysis in "S. cerevisiae" that comprises about 75% of all yeast genes.
Collateral lethality is a sub-case of synthetic lethality in personalized cancer therapy, where vulnerabilities are exposed by the deletion of passenger genes rather than tumor suppressor genes, which are deleted by virtue of chromosomal proximity to major deleted tumor suppressor loci.
Mutations in genes employed in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) cause a high mutation rate.
In tumors, such frequent subsequent mutations often generate "non-self" immunogenic antigens.
A human Phase II clinical trial, with 41 patients, evaluated one synthetic lethal approach for tumors with or without MMR defects.
In the case of sporadic tumors evaluated, the majority would be deficient in MMR due to epigenetic repression of an MMR gene (see DNA mismatch repair).
The product of gene "PD-1" ordinarily represses cytotoxic immune responses.
Inhibition of this gene allows a greater immune response.
In this Phase II clinical trial with 47 patients, when cancer patients with a defect in MMR in their tumors were exposed to an inhibitor of PD-1, 67% - 78% of patients experienced immune-related progression-free survival.
In contrast, for patients without defective MMR, addition of PD-1 inhibitor generated only 11% of patients with immune-related progression-free survival.
Thus inhibition of PD-1 is primarily synthetically lethal with MMR defects.
The analysis of 630 human primary tumors in 11 tissues shows that "WRN" promoter hypermethylation (with loss of expression of WRN protein) is a common event in tumorigenesis.
The "WRN" gene promoter is hypermethylated in about 38% of colorectal cancers and non-small-cell lung carcinomas and in about 20% or so of stomach cancers, prostate cancers, breast cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphomas and chondrosarcomas, plus at significant levels in the other cancers evaluated.
The WRN helicase protein is important in homologous recombinational DNA repair and also has roles in non-homologous end joining DNA repair and base excision DNA repair.
Topoisomerase inhibitors are frequently used as chemotherapy for different cancers, though they cause bone marrow suppression, are cardiotoxic and have variable effectiveness.
A 2006 retrospective study, with long clinical follow-up, was made of colon cancer patients treated with the topoisomerase inhibitor irinotecan.
In this study, 45 patients had hypermethylated "WRN" gene promoters and 43 patients had unmethylated "WRN" gene promoters.
Irinitecan was more strongly beneficial for patients with hypermethylated "WRN" promoters (39.4 months survival) than for those with unmethylated "WRN" promoters (20.7 months survival).
Thus, a topoisomerase inhibitor appeared to be synthetically lethal with deficient expression of "WRN".
Further evaluations have also indicated synthetic lethality of deficient expression of "WRN" and topoisomerase inhibitors.
As reviewed by Murata et al., five different PARP1 inhibitors are now undergoing Phase I, II and III clinical trials, to determine if particular PARP1 inhibitors are synthetically lethal in a large variety of cancers, including those in the prostate, pancreas, non-small-cell lung tumors, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and Ewing sarcoma.
In addition, in preclinical studies using cells in culture or within mice, PARP1 inhibitors are being tested for synthetic lethality against epigenetic and mutational deficiencies in about 20 DNA repair defects beyond BRCA1/2 deficiencies.
These include deficiencies in "PALB2", "FANCD2", "RAD51", "ATM", "MRE11", "p53", "XRCC1" and "LSD1".
ARID1A, a chromatin modifier, is required for non-homologous end joining, a major pathway that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA, and also has transcription regulatory roles. "ARID1A" mutations are one of the 12 most common carcinogenic mutations.
Mutation or epigenetically decreased expression of "ARID1A" has been found in 17 types of cancer.
Pre-clinical studies in cells and in mice show that synthetic lethality for deficient "ARID1A" expression occurs by either inhibition of the methyltransferase activity of EZH2, by inhibition of the DNA repair kinase ATR, or by exposure to the kinase inhibitor dasatinib.
There are two pathways for homologous recombinational repair of double-strand breaks.
The major pathway depends on BRCA1, PALB2 and BRCA2 while an alternative pathway depends on RAD52.
Pre-clinical studies, involving epigenetically reduced or mutated "BRCA"-deficient cells (in culture or injected into mice), show that inhibition of RAD52 is synthetically lethal with "BRCA"-deficiency.
Although treatments using synthetic lethality can stop or slow progression of cancers and prolong survival, each of the synthetic lethal treatments has some adverse side effects.
For example, more than 20% of patients treated with an inhibitor of PD-1 encounter fatigue, rash, pruritus, cough, diarrhea, decreased appetite, constipation or arthralgia.
Thus, it is important to determine which DDR deficiency is present, so that only an effective synthetic lethal treatment can be applied, and not unnecessarily subject patients to adverse side effects without a direct benefit.
Ričardas Gavelis (November 8, 1950 in Vilnius, Lithuania – August 18, 2002) was a writer, playwright, and journalist.

Henry Arthur 'Harry' Dowdall (29 June 1872 – 9 May 1912) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Collingwood in the 1897 inaugural Victorian Football League (VFL) season.
The son of James Dowdall and Isabella McGowan, Harry was small of stature and lightly built, and used these traits to his advantage, particularly in wet weather.
Harry's older brother Jim had both previously played for South Melbourne in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) from 1887, with Harry playing in the 2nd Twenty.
In 1892 they both tried to move to Collingwood.
Jim was unsuccessful and instead played for Richmond.
In Collingwood's final game of the 1897 VFL season, Harry refused to play unless he was allowed to play on the ball for the entirety of the game.
Although not pleasing Collingwood officials with his stance, he remained at the club for a further three seasons, playing 38 games and kicking 21 goals, before crossing to St Kilda in 1901 at the age of 29, where he played only one game.
Newspaper reports of the time spell his name (and Jim's) variously as Dowdell/Dowdall.
Dowdall is correct.
In 2013 Kai Hirano is moved from Kataller Toyama to Buriram United in Thai Premier League.

Crow's Nest Natural Area Preserve is a large wilderness area located on the southern border of Stafford County, Virginia, United States, between Potomac Creek and Accokeek Creek.
The greater portion of the Crow's Nest Peninsula is approximately and lies within the coastal plain of Virginia.
About of the peninsula is protected as part of the Virginia Natural Area Preserve System.
Virtually the entire Crow's Nest Peninsula is forested with an impressive, mature stand of mixed hardwoods.
Hardwood forests of this extent are becoming increasingly rare in the Virginia and Chesapeake Bay coastal plain due to prevalent forestry practices and fragmentation of natural areas for development and agriculture.
The size and continuity of this hardwood stand enhance its viability and its value in providing a large, unfragmented natural area for diverse organisms.
Within a relatively short time (50–100 years), this forest will also comprise a substantial occurrence of old-growth forest with inestimable scientific, biological, and aesthetic values.
Currently, trees greater than diameter at breast height (dbh) are common, and very large relict tree specimens are scattered throughout the site.
The entire Crow's Nest Peninsula is undeveloped and is primarily forested with mature stands of hardwood trees such as oaks and hickories.
This is especially true in the eastern half of the peninsula and the northern slopes facing Accokeek Creek.
The coastal plain landscape in this region of Virginia was formed beginning in the late Triassic period, approximately 230 million years ago, through the rise and fall of the sea.
Crow's Nest is approximately in length from east to west, across and rises above the surrounding Accokeek and Potomac creeks.
The peninsula is highly dissected on its north and south sides by steep ravines flowing into these two fresh-water tidal creeks.
In contrast, most landscapes in the coastal plain of Virginia are relatively flat and/or gently rolling.
Crow's Nest's dramatic rise to above Potomac and Accokeek creeks is startling compared to the adjacent peninsulas in Stafford County, such as Marlborough Point and Widewater Peninsula, which are relatively flat.
A large portion of Crow's Nest is composed of calcareous, or calcium-rich, soil layers from ocean or marine animals that once lived at the bottom of a vast inland sea.
Most soils in the Piedmont and coastal plain of Virginia are not calcareous or limey and thus tend to be acidic.
This calcareous soil strata within Potomac Creek is referred to as the Aquia Formation, which is 60 million years old.
The Aquia Formation is found within a larger outcrop belt known as the Pamunkey Group, a sequence of Lower Tertiary (Paleocene-Eocene) sands and clays that formed in shallow marine environments beneath the western margin of the Atlantic Ocean.
The Aquia Formation is composed of marine sediments that are dark green to gray-green, argillaceous, highly glauconitic, well sorted fine-to medium grained sand with shell beds up to in depth.
Today, shell-marl/calcareous ravine forests such as those at Crow's Nest are not common anywhere in the mid-Atlantic region.
These plant communities are rare to this coastal plain ecosystem.
There are two nutrient-rich plant communities associated with lime sands and localized shell concretions at Crow's Nest.
One can be broadly classified as Basic Mesic Forests (G2, globally imperiled).
Another rare community found at Crow's Nest that is typically associated with the shell-marl/calcareous environments is the Basic Oak-Hickory Forest (G2, globally imperiled).
These are found on two very steep slopes facing Potomac Creek and represent this plant community.
Much of the shell-marl/calcareous ravine forests that do still exist on the east coast of the United States have since been heavily logged.
In assessing natural communities in need of protection, the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation listed the state's few remaining calcareous ravine forests to be conservation priorities.
The Crow's Nest site is perhaps Virginia's best remaining example of this rare forest community.
Due to the unusual subsurface calcareous soil formations underlying most of the peninsula, the unusual soils are basic (alkaline) and give rise to rare plants and plant communities.
This is due to the ability of the limey soils at Crow's Nest to neutralize and buffer soil pH within the range 6.3 to 6.8.
Elements such as calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) create conditions in the soil that raise the pH of the soil and increase nutrient availability for plants.
This results in the establishment of more robust and diverse vegetation at Crow's Nest.
Additionally, disjunct plant communities at Crow's Nest are found that are not common in the Piedmont and coastal plain of Virginia, as these areas generally have lower pH soils.
These rare or "disjunct" plants and plant communities include small-flower baby-blue-eyes ("Nemophila aphylla") and glade fern ("Athyrium pycnocarpon").
After assisting and conducting field surveys for rare plant species and plant communities, the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, Division of Natural Heritage determined in 1999 that "Crow's Nest is considered one of the finest, if not the finest example of mature forests remaining in the Coastal Plain of Virginia."
These forest communities on the peninsula consist of several distinct community types.
The peninsula supports several regionally and globally rare plants and plant communities, two of which are ranked Globally Imperiled (G2) by NatureServe.
The mid-Atlantic Ridge started to form in the early Jurassic period (175 million years ago), breaking apart the super continent Pangaea and beginning the expansion of the modern Atlantic Ocean.
It has widened steadily to its present size.
This rifting event separated North America from Africa, and the area known today as Virginia became the trailing edge of the newly formed North American continent.
The Jurassic Period is found in the Mesozoic Era, or the Age of the Dinosaurs.
The Mesozoic Era spanned a length of time from 251 million years ago to 66 million years ago.
In the early Eocene Epoch (55.8 million years ago) the Coastal Plain of Virginia was completely underwater.
Sediment accumulating beneath this sea eventually would become the Crow's Nest of today.
The Paleocene and the Eocene epochs are found in the Cenozoic Era, or the age of the mammals.
The Cenozoic Era spanned a length of time from 66 million years ago to the present.
During the Eocene, the Atlantic Ocean was considerably narrower than it is today, making migration relatively easy for marine animals.
The climate of Virginia during this period was considerably warmer than it is today.
According to extensive records, the Earth experienced its warmest interval of the past 66 million years during the early Eocene, and Virginia was probably much warmer than central and southern Florida today.
The remains of large alligators and turtles have been found at this latitude in Virginia.
The calcareous soil strata within Potomac Creek, the Aquia Formation, is 60 million years old.
This formation is found within a larger outcrop belt known as the Pamunkey Group, a sequence of Lower Tertiary (Paleocene-Eocene, 55.8 million years ago) sands and clays that formed in shallow marine environments beneath the western margin of the Atlantic Ocean.
The Aquia Formation is composed of marine sediments that are dark green to gray-green, argillaceous, highly glauconitic, well sorted, fine-to medium-grained sand with shell beds up to in depth.
Crow's Nest has been referred to as a "biological gem".
There have been few formal surveys for rare plant and animal species, however, mostly conducted by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation in the late 1990s.
Virtually the entire Crow's Nest Peninsula is forested with mature stands of mixed hardwoods.
In the words of Gary Fleming, Natural Heritage Program ecologist, "Overall, Crow's Nest supports one of the finest—if not the finest—upland hardwood forests remaining in the Virginia Coastal Plain."
Surveys documented two state-listed species and the potential habitat for two other federal listed species and several state-listed species.
Several Stafford County records for plants and two state-listed endangered plant species were found, including ginseng ("Panax quinquefolius") in rich ravines and river bulrush ("Scirpus fluviatilis") in adjacent tidal marshes.
Suitable habitat was found for small whorled pogonia ("Isotria medeoloides"), although it does not grow there.
The peninsula is forested with huge trees, some over in diameter, including chinkapin oak ("Quercus muhlenbergii") and tulip poplar ("Liriodendron tulipifera").
Other trees include bitternut hickory ("Carya cordiformis"), pignut hickory ("Carya glabra"), black walnut ("Juglans nigra"), and black locust ("Robinia pseudoacacia").
In addition to the high-quality forests found at Crow's Nest, there are approximately of freshwater tidal marshes surrounding the peninsula that account for 60% of all marshes in Stafford County.
The marshes are in nearly pristine condition and represent some of the best examples found in the state.
Several environmental factors exert important influences on vegetation on the Crow's Nest Peninsula.
First, the steep terrain made most of the site unsuitable for agriculture, so it was never fragmented or plowed.
It is one of the largest unfragmented patches of hardwood forests in Virginia's coastal plain.
The steepness also limited logging to a substantial degree.
Secondly, the mix of freshwater tidal wetlands, ravine bottoms, steep slopes of various aspect, and high ridgecrests has led to a high biodiversity, including sites important in neotropical bird migration.
Lastly, the Lower Tertiary deposits in this part of the mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain consist largely of glauconitic sand, shelly clay-silt, and some sandy limestone and calcium-rich sands.
These contribute to the development of relatively basic, nutrient-rich soils.
Basic or calcareous soil environments are uncommon to rare on the Virginia coastal plain and can support vegetation unusual for the region.
Crow's Nest is surrounded on three sides by a freshwater-tidal estuary, and a multitude of resident and spawning fish thrive in these waters.
Local fishermen captured the shortnose sturgeon ("Acipenser brevirostrum"), a federally listed endangered fish, twice in 2002.
A variety of marine fossils have been found on the shores of Crow's Nest.
These include Paleocene-epoch shark teeth, as well as ancient parts of rays, turtles, and numerous mollusks of genus "Turritella". "Turritella" has an elongated, highly coiled corkscrew shape.
The internal molds and casts of these gastropods can be found in these waters and are especially plentiful at nearby Bull Bluff on Potomac Creek.
Many of the calcareous ravine forests on the east coast of the United States have been logged, and the Virginia Department of Conservation listed this ecosystem as a conservation priority.
The Crow's Nest site is one of Virginia's best remaining examples of this rare habitat and associated vegetation types.
These communities are rare in the coastal plain ecosystem.
The principal rich forest associated with ravines down-cutting into lime sands and localized shell concretions is currently classified as the Northern Coastal Plain/Piedmont Basic Mesic Hardwood Forest and is found on two dry, very steep slopes facing Potomac Creek.
More study is required for a better understanding of the environment and ecology at Crow's Nest.
In the larger context of biodiversity protection in Virginia and the mid-Atlantic region, the factors which contribute to the unique character of this region and its important neotropical migrant populations include its size, large-patch community dynamics, its diversity of habitats, and the known or potential occurrence of rare ecosystems and biota.
Crow's Nest Peninsula is steeped in important local, state and national history.
Important events happened here, and important people lived extraordinary lives at Crow's Nest.
Evidence of significant Native American, colonial, Civil War and modern history are found at Crow's Nest and the adjoining lands within the estuary of Potomac and Accokeek creeks.
The archaeological record reveals that native peoples have been in this area of the coastal plain of Virginia since the Early Archaic period, around 9000 BC.
It was thought that due to the steep topography at Crow's Nest the Patawomecks may not have lived in permanent villages adjacent to the surrounding water, though they definitely hunted and camped there.
In October 2005, Cultural Resources Inc. (CRI) conducted a Phase I archaeological resource inventory of Crow's Nest and found archaeological evidence of several Late Woodland domestic occupations associated with hamlets or villages.
In one area of Crow's Nest, a large number of unfinished stone points were found, indicating that Indians had once used the property as a stone-tool-making workshop.
Directly across the mouth of Accokeek Creek from Crow's Nest Point there are the archaeological remains of a Patawomeck Indian town at Indian Point on the Marlborough Point Peninsula's western tip. "Patawomeke Town" was a community of the Patawomeck tribe for which the Potomac River is named.
There are several different spellings for the native people who inhabited this area. ("Patawomeck" will be used in this article.)
The original pronunciation may never be known.
This area of Potomac Creek and the Potomac River is a boundary between three major Late Woodland Period Indian groups, Iroquoian-speaking people to the north, Siouan-speaking people to the western Piedmont, and Algonquian-speaking people on Potomac Creek.
The name "Patawomeck" name may mean "trading place".
It is certainly true that Potomac Creek Ware is iconic to the region and has a wide distribution, found hundreds of miles from its place of origin.
One of the most endangered archaeological sites in Virginia, the remains of a large 13th century and 13-ringed palisaded Indian community was found next to Indian Point, nationally catalogued as 44ST2.
Today, small pieces of cord-impressed Potomac Creek Ware pottery continue to be found along the shoreline.
Radiocarbon dates on carbonized wood at this site have established that the town was occupied between 1300 AD and 1550 AD.
The latter dates suggest that this particular town was not inhabited by the post-contact period in the 17th century, and that a neighboring village site (44ST1) at Indian Point had replaced it by then.
John Smith encountered the Patawomecks in 1608.
Indian Point is believed to be where Pocahontas, Powhatan's daughter, was captured by Captain Samuel Argall in 1613.
Relatively peaceful relations between the English and Patawomecks continued from 1608 to 1619.
Captain Samuel Argall with his ship "Discovery" sailed into Potomac Creek and gained nearly 400 bushels of corn, peas and beans and many furs in 1610.
It is believed that trade with the Patawomecks increased the chances of Jamestown Colony surviving the first ten years.
The Patawomecks did not fight against the English in the first Indian war led by Opchanacanough against the English in March 1622.
By the summer of 1622 documentation exists that a Captain Madyson tragically turned on the Patawomeck tribe, killing 30-40 and burning a village.
By the 1670s English homesteads dotted the Potomac River shores far past Potomac Creek.
There was a gradual abandonment of the Patawomeck homelands, with the people primarily going to live among other Algonquian-speakers, including the Potopacos (Portobago Bay on the Rappahannock River to the south.
The Potomac Neck area was patented to John Rookwood and later to Giles Brent in 1651.
The last chief of the Patawomecks, Wahanganoche, was alleged to be murdered in Caroline County, Virginia, in 1664.
Historical records show that the Patawomecks ceased to exist as an organized society after the late 17th century.
In her book "Pocahontas’s People", Helen Roundtree states that "No patent mentions the site of the Patawomeck town and no documents mention the Patawomecks at all after 1665."
Frank Speck, author of "Chapters on the Ethnology of the Powhatan Tribes of Virgini", believed that a small group of families, whose names are mostly Newton and Green, represent what may be the residue of the Indians who are recorded to have inhabited Potomac Creek.
Speck estimates their number back in the 1920s to be about 150.
The records of the people who were descendants to the Patawomecks were largely destroyed during the Civil War.
Additionally, it may not have been popular in the 18th and 19th centuries to claim Indian ancestry due to the racial attitudes that existed then.
This may be one of the reasons that state recognition of the Patawomecks as an Indian tribe is difficult to achieve.
Nevertheless, in the 1990s, the descendant community of the native peoples of Potomac Creek reorganized as the "Patawomeck Tribe" and conduct regular tribal events and powwows in Stafford County.
The Patawomeck received official recognition from the Commonwealth of Virginia in February 2010.
Not much is known about Crow's Nest's direct involvement during the American Civil War except for the burning of the Daniel homes and their eviction from Crow's Nest.
Due to its close proximity to well-documented military sites and activities, Crow's Nest undoubtedly harbored Union forces at the time.
According to D.P.
Newton of Stafford County and curator of the White Oak Museum in Stafford, a brigade of Union troops held ground at Crow's Nest.
Stafford County is situated halfway between the capitals of the Union and Confederacy during the Civil War and thus became a large depot for important campaigns in Fredericksburg, Spotsylvania County, and Orange County.
According to the National Park Service, "the area around Fredericksburg has the most blood-soaked ground than anywhere in America."
The battles of Fredericksburg, Wilderness, Chancellorsville, and Spotsylvania Courthouse were fought within a radius all south of Crow's Nest.
Eric Mink, historian with the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park, interprets the following events surrounding Crow's Nest in south Stafford: "With Virginia's secession from the Union in April 1861, Stafford County quickly became part of the frontier between the warring sections of the country.
The nearness of the Potomac River caused immense concern among Confederate authorities, as the idea of large flotillas of Union gunboats descending the Potomac resulted in panic among Virginia residents.
In May 1861, Confederate forces moved into Stafford County and erected batteries along the Potomac shore.
The idea was to create a blockade of the river that would neither allow warships to descend the river, nor allow supply ships up to Alexandria and Washington, D.C.
The defenses also helped to protect the northern terminus of the Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac Railroad, located at Aquia Creek Landing.
Artillery positions were established at the mouth of Aquia Creek and even on Marlborough Point.
The Potomac batteries harassed Yankee shipping throughout the winter of 1861 and 1862."
Because of its location on the Potomac River and its proximity to Fredericksburg, Aquia Landing was destined to play an important role in the Civil War.
It was the site of one of the war's earliest military engagements and became a major supply base for the Army of the Potomac in three separate campaigns.
On May 31, 1863, there was the first engagement of the Civil War between the U.S. Navy and the shore batteries of the Confederacy at Aquia Landing.
In the spring of 1862, the war shifted south toward Richmond, and the Confederates abandoned the Potomac River defenses.
As fate would have it, Crow's Nest would be in the wake of the northern Armies of the Potomac that would occupy south Stafford.
Since 1854, the terminus of the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad (RF&P) had been located at Aquia Landing, where travelers transferred to steamships to complete their journey to Washington, D.C.
Subsequently, Federal armies arrived en masse in southern Stafford County in 1862.
Aquia Landing and Belle Plains, directly across from Crow's Nest, immediately became critical junctions for moving men and material southward.
Potomac Creek became a major off-loading and depot for tens of thousands of men engaged in fighting the major campaigns in the Fredericksburg area.
During the Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville campaigns, from November 1862 through June 1863, southern Stafford County was occupied by more than 100,000 troops of the Federal Army of the Potomac.
Union forces marched into Stafford County in the spring of 1862.
While the war played out around Richmond, Federals in Stafford County acted as a barrier or shield for Washington, D.C.
The Potomac River became the lifeline for the Federals in Stafford.
Supplies steamed down the river and to Aquia Creek Landing.
The Federal occupation lasted through the spring and summer, before developments around Manassas forced the evacuation of Stafford in September 1862.
The Union Army of the Potomac returned to Stafford County in November 1862.
Over 100,000 strong, the Federals made the southern part of the county their home for the following seven months.
Once again the Potomac River was alive with ships and transports, bringing supplies, food and equipment.
More landings opened to handle the steamers and barges.
Aquia Creek Landing was again very busy, as were wharves at Belle Plains, Hope Landing and Marlborough Point.
Hospitals grew up around these landings, as battle casualties and sickness took its toll on the Union army.
Throughout southern Stafford County, winter camps sprang up, and the occupation of the area changed its appearance.
Wood lots fell to the soldiers' axes, and small huts covered once-farmed fields.
Almost certainly, the area known as Crow's Nest felt the intrusion of war, given its close proximity to Belle Plains and the shipping lanes.
It is likely that camps and hospitals were established there, although documentation of these sites remains scant.
In June 1863, the military activities shifted elsewhere, and once again the Union army abandoned Stafford County.
Their return did not come until May 1864.
In 1862, after General Burnside's costly loss at the battle of Fredericksburg, the Federal Army of the Potomac went into winter camp, with many Federal units bivouacked in southern Stafford County over the next eight months of the 1862 campaign.
The largest known encampment near Crow's Nest was located at Belle Plains on the southern bank of Potomac Creek.
In addition to a camp, supply base and a hospital, Belle Plains was also a prisoner of war camp for Confederate troops captured during the battles of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania Courthouse in 1864.
Today, this area is known as Belle Plains.
The spring of 1864 saw a renewed Union offense in Virginia.
In the central part of the state, the Army of the Potomac drove into the heart of Spotsylvania County.
The battles of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court House produced horrific casualties, as well as prisoners.
Wounded Union soldiers and Confederate prisoners, destined for the hospitals and prisons in the north, were transported once again to the base at Belle Plains.
A large prison holding area along the south side of Potomac Creek became known as the "Punch Bowl".
Thousands of southern soldiers were held there while they awaited transportation north.
Across the creek, on the Crow's Nest peninsula, wartime maps show that the captors set up artillery positions to cover the prisoners.
As the war shifted south, once again Stafford County was left to its inhabitants.
They felt the intrusion of the Union army only once more, when in June 1865 the victorious forces of the United States marched through the county on their way home to Washington, D.C. Stafford County was devastated by the Federal occupation.
The great conflict left south Stafford County barren and almost completely devoid of trees, food, forage and homes.
Many homes were burned, and the population of Stafford County was greatly reduced.
The northern troops destroyed hundreds of homes, and those that remained were severely damaged.
The countryside was denuded of vegetation, and agricultural fields were trampled and reduced to over-ground patches of wild shrubbery.
The Daniel family of Crows Nest did not fare well during the Civil War period.
As previously stated, going back to March 1857, Supreme Court Justice Peter Vivian Daniel was a part of an overwhelming majority of the Court who decided Dred Scott should be returned to slavery in the infamous Dred Scott Decision of 1857.
He served on the Court until his death in 1860.
Although Moncure Daniel Conway, one of the most famous Southern abolitionists at the time, was related to the Daniel family, Stafford County was Confederate territory, and the inhabitants of Crow's Nest were considered southern sympathizers.
According to Raleigh Travers Daniel, whose father was born at Crow's Nest, "the northern armies forced the evacuation of the family home and the house was fired upon."
According to Jerrilynn Eby: "As the marauding Union soldiers streamed onto the tract in 1862, the family loaded a wagon with what they could carry and fled towards Fredericksburg.
While crossing the Rappahannock River, the wagon overturned and all their belongings were lost.
Back at Crow's Nest, the Union soldiers ransacked the house, carrying off whatever they wished.
Because it offered such a fine vantage point of the creek, the soldiers set fire to the house, thus preventing its use by Confederates.
When the family finally returned to Crow's Nest, all that remained was a small table out in the yard.
Some soldier had carried it out of the house, perhaps decided it was too large to take with him, and dropped it in the yard.
It was the family's only household possession that survived the war.
By the 1920s another house had been built on the tract, this one standing in the approximate center of the peninsula."
Additionally, Eby states, "During the War Between the States, the "Crow" was used for blockade running, much to the dismay of the Union.
Northern gunboats finally cornered the "Crow" and her crew in Potomac Creek.
Had they captured the ship, the Crow would have been confiscated for use by the invading forces.
Realizing that the situation was hopeless, the captain of the "Crow" ordered the crew to raise all sails and attain maximum speed.
Rather than lose his ship to the Union cause, the captain ran her aground on the sand bar off Marlborough Point, crushing the hull.
The crew then waded ashore and disappeared into the safety of the Stafford forest.
The ribs of the ship remained near the shoreline well into the 20th century."
After the death of John Moncure Daniel III in 1865, the remarkable history of Crow's Nest seems to have come to an abrupt end as the Daniel family was forcefully evicted from the property in the 1860s and the inhabitants of the peninsula were gone.
Stanley is a village on the north side of the River Tay in Perthshire, Scotland, just north of Perth.
This section of the River Tay is a popular location for canoeing and fishing.
The village of Stanley gains its name from Lady Amelia Stanley, the daughter of James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby.
In the 1600s the area around Stanley was part of the estate of Earls of Atholl and was also the location of Inchbervis Castle.
In 1659 the castle was renamed Stanley House in honour of the wedding of John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl and Lady Stanley.
When the village was built in the 1700s it took the name Stanley after the nearby house.
John Murray, the 4th Duke of Atholl, decided in the 18th century to harness of the nearby River Tay to power a cotton mill.
Richard Arkwright, an inventor of cotton-spinning machinery was persuaded by George Dempster (the local MP), while Dempster was visiting Cromford in Derbyshire, to come to Scotland to set up a cotton mill in Stanley as well as one at New Lanark.
Stanley Mills opened in 1787, and by its 10th year employed 350 people.
The village of Stanley was built to house the workers of the mill.
Work on the village began in 1784.
It was designed by the Duke of Atholl’s factor James Stobie.
By 1799 the village’s population was around 400, and by 1831 it had reached around 2000 residents, about 50% of whom worked in the mill.
Stanley was largely founded to house workers for a huge mill on the banks of the River Tay.
The mill was originally water-powered but was later converted to steam and finally to electric power.
For most of its history it produced cotton thread, but in the 20th century changed to cigarette ribbon.
The Dempster & Co company was established in 1787 by seven men including Richard Arkwright, George Dempster and William Sandeman to build the mill on land feued from the Duke of Atholl to provide employment to Highlanders affected by the clearances.
A fire in 1799 destroyed a large section of the mill and it reopened in 1802, partly with advice from David Dale of New Lanark (which it closely resembles).
The mill used coal gas for lighting until 1921, when this was replaced by a hydroelectric power plant, which was built to also supply electricity to the village.
The power station was closed in 1965 but was reopened in 2003 by npower (UK).
From the 1960s the mill was in decline, and it finally closed down in 1989.
After that the mill fell derelict.
Historic Scotland bought the mill in 1995 and over the next ten years, in liaison with the Phoenix Trust, the buildings renovated and turned into private flats plus a museum depicting life in the 19th century and the story of the mill.
A railway station was built in Stanley in 1848.
This later evolved into a junction station, as it lay at the point where the branch line to Forfar broke off from the main line from Perth to Inverness.
The Perth Inverness line still runs though the village, however, but the station was closed in 1956.
Ballathie House was built during the 1850s near Stanley.
It was built by the Robertson family, the land having originally been owned by the Drummond family, the Earls of Perth.
Since 1972 it has operated as a country house hotel.
Cleolinda "Cleo" Jones is an American writer and blogger.
She is the author of the "Movies in Fifteen Minutes" series of film parodies, which have a large cult following on the internet.
In addition to her published books, she is also known for her commentary on pop culture elements, particularly the growth and development of "fandom" culture for "Twilight", "Harry Potter", "The Hunger Games" and "Hannibal".
Jones currently lives in Birmingham, where she is a post-graduate student.
In 2005, Orion Books published "Movies in Fifteen Minutes: Hollywood Blockbusters for People Who Can't Be Bothered", a collection of more parodies by Jones.
The book has also been published abroad as "Cut: Movies in Fifteen Minutes", but has yet to be published in Jones' native United States. "Movies in Fifteen Minutes" was praised for being "hilarious – but [also intelligent;] it's the pretensions of James Cameron and Mel Gibson [that Jones] is mocking, not Dickens and Shakespeare".
As a follow-up to "Movies in Fifteen Minutes", Jones has also self-published an e-book, "The Annotated Movies in Fifteen Minutes:" " (1) Wizards".
It focuses on her humorous recaps of the "Harry Potter" films, with fandom commentary, interactive links, and historical notes in addition to the recaps.
Jones's recaps of "Breaking Dawn", the fourth book in the "Twilight" series, were heavily referenced in a blog posting in "New York Magazine".
Jones's blog was quoted in the MSNBC article "A beginner's guide to "Twilight" - How to pretend like you know what your teenage daughter is talking about", a commentary written by Dave White.
Her recaps of Season 1 of "Hannibal" attracted a large following of both fans of the show and entertainment analysts, as Jones often included a meta-analysis of the horror genre elements included in each show for discussion.
Her "People in Dracula don't know they're in Dracula" problem analysis was included in "The Atlantic" feature, "The Formula That's Ruining Teen Movies", in 2013.
In 2014, Jones' work was included in "Athena's Daughters", an anthology of science fiction and fantasy stories about women, by women.
The project was part of a "Silence in the Library" Kickstarter campaign which later grew to include multiple sequels.
Proceeds from the book supported RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network), the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization.
Tim Kellett (born 23 July 1964 in Knaresborough, Yorkshire, England) is an English musician, songwriter and record producer.
Kellett has worked in the British music industry for the past twenty five years.
His professional career began in 1984, when he joined the British post-punk band The Durutti Column as trumpeter, but he left in 1985 to join Simply Red where he also played keyboards and performed backing vocals live.
According to MTV he joined Simply Red earlier in 1981.
They had a No.2 UK / No.1 US hit in 1986 with "Holding Back The Years".
Kellett left the band in 1991.
In 1994, Kellett formed Olive with Robin Taylor-Firth, also of Nightmares on Wax.
Olive had a No.1 UK hit in May 1997 with "You're Not Alone" before going on hiatus in 2001.
Kellett also had success in writing songs for The Lighthouse Family and, more recently, James Morrison and Matthew Ward.
Other collaborations include Nate James, Ella Chi, Emma Bunton, Gareth Gates, Girls Aloud, Christophe William and Taio Cruz.
The latter wrote and produced with Kellett on the track "Never Gonna Get Us" for Cruz's 2008 "Departure" album.
Big Survey Wildlife Management Area is a Wildlife Management Area in Wythe County, Virginia.
The preserve's woodland sits on four mountain ridges and divides the watersheds of Reed and Cripple creeks in the New River Valley.
Among the trees and shrubs to be found there are rhododendron, azalea, oak, hickory, and pine.
Big Survey Wildlife Management Area is owned and maintained by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries.
The area is open to the public for hunting, hiking, horseback riding, and camping.
Access for persons 17 years of age or older requires a valid hunting permit, fishing permit, or WMA access permit.
Emilio Óscar Rabasa Mishkin (23 January 1925 – 14 June 2008) was a Mexican politician, diplomat and academic.
Rabasa Mishkin was born in Mexico City, the son of Oscar Rabasa, a distinguished Mexican diplomat, and Mrs. Lillian Mishkin, and grandson of constitutional lawyer, poet, and one-time Governor of Chiapas Emilio Rabasa Estebanell (1856–1930).
He studied law at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where he also earned his J.D. and later founded the Faculty of Political and Social Sciences.
Rabasa served as Ambassador to the United States in 1970–71, during the government of U.S. President Richard Nixon.
On 1 December 1970, President Luis Echeverría appointed him Secretary of Foreign Affairs.
He oversaw a period of intense diplomatic activity, during which Mexico doubled (from 67 to 129) the number of countries with which it maintained diplomatic relations, particularly among the nations of the Third World and the Non-Aligned Movement.
During Rabasa's time at the foreign ministry, Mexico refused to impose OAS-led sanctions on Castro's Cuba and admitted a flood of political refugees from Pinochet's Chile.
Rabasa was also instrumental in the country's adoption of a Economic Exclusion Zone and the creation of the Matías Romero Diplomatic Studies Institute.
He also signed Mexico's first cooperation agreement with the European Economic Community.
Rabasa resigned from the cabinet on 28 December 1975, due to differences of opinion with President Echeverría arising from heightened international tensions following Mexico's vote in favour of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379, equating Zionism with racism.
He was replaced by Alfonso García Robles.
After he stepped down he wrote several books including "History of the Mexican Constitution", "The Political Thought of the Constituent" and "Environmental Law".
He later served at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague and on the OAS's Inter-American Juridical Committee in Rio de Janeiro.
Rabasa died on 14 June 2008 of heart failure.
